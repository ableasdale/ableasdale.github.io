<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>My decision to
examine both of Felman’s statements has imposed – and to some degree, <i>created</i>
– a structure for my essay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I intend to
use the first statement as a starting point and to gravitate towards the second
statement in due course with a critical analysis of some of the shared terms
that serve to forge links between both statements.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It is my belief that a degree of overlap exists between them, and
therefore my intention is to investigate both statements with the intention of
identifying some of these linking factors as my essay plays out.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Felman opens the
question with the initial claim that ‘while literature is considered as a body
of <i>language – to be interpreted</i> – psychoanalysis is considered as a body
of <i>knowledge</i>, whose competence is called upon to <i>interpret</i>’
(1982:5).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She broadly categorises
psychoanalysis as <i>subject</i> and literature as <i>object</i>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is set further in place by applying a
master/slave structure to them; there is a dynamic encounter, which becomes a
‘fight for recognition’ where the authority of psychoanalysis is called upon –
as a subject - to play the analyst.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
text becomes the analysand, and serves the subject’s desire for
recognition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Psychoanalysis therefore
exercises both authority and power over the text, satisfying itself by ‘holding
a discourse of masterly competence’ (<i>ibid</i>:6).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Therefore psychoanalysis <i>points to the unconscious of
literature</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The initial
master/slave ‘frame of relationship’ - in Felman’s terms – quickly becomes
problematic when any equal (or ‘real’) dialogue occurs between psychoanalysis
and literature (literature, in literary terms, <i>is</i> a body of knowledge
and psychoanalysis <i>is</i> a body of language).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Therefore the ‘monologic’ structure can be - and for Felman, is -
reversed from a literary perspective where the literary text can take the
authoritative role.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally, through
applying a linguistic structure to psychoanalysis, she suggests that the binary
structure of [master/slave] opposition should be deconstructed; that literary
analysis can be conducted irrespective of choosing between the roles of analyst
and analysand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So Felman
identifies an inherent paradox: on the one hand, the process of literary
analysis resembles that of psychoanalysis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>On the other, the status of the literary text can resemble the master:
the ‘subject presumed to know’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Also,
the process of reading, it is argued, can function using the same parameters of
authority as described by Lacan in his definition of the ‘role of the
psychoanalyst in the structure of transference’ (<i>ibid</i>:7).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On reading, the literary critic occupies two
roles: the analyst in interpretation and the analysand in relation to
transference from the text.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I will
later examine the functioning of transference in relation to Felman’s second
statement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Irony, Felman
suggests, is a literary device that further deconstructs the ‘temptation’ to
map a master/slave opposition onto an interaction between literature and
psychoanalysis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The nature of irony,
Felman argues, ‘consists in dragging authority as such into a scene which it
cannot master’ (<i>ibid</i>:8), that the ‘ironic force’ behind a literary text
must, by virtue of its ironic nature, deconstruct any existing ‘fantasy of
authority’ for the same reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Therefore, application of the master/slave model to an ironic literary
moment renders false any ‘professional’ (or masterful) claims made by
psychoanalysis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I will develop this
point again later in this essay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In <i>To Open the
Question</i>, Felman is urging a shift of emphasis, one that rules out ‘<i>application</i>’
of psychoanalysis over literature and gestures towards ‘<i>implication</i>’:
involving psychoanalysis with literary analysis.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>By doing so, ‘the interpreter’s role would here be (…) to act as
a go-between, to <i>generate implications</i> between literature and
psychoanalysis<i> </i>’ (<i>ibid</i>:9).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In this way, Felman observes that although both ‘domains’ can be seen to
inform each other, each are ‘also affected, displaced, by the other’ (<i>ibid.</i>).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Felman then states that literature is the ‘<i>inherent
reference </i>by which psychoanalysis names its findings’ and argues that –
despite their differences – they are ‘enfolded within’ each other; that ‘there
are no <i>natural</i> boundaries between (…) which clearly define and
distinguish them’ (<i>ibid.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If
this is taken to be true (and Felman certainly argues its case), then it is
possible to see how each domain can threaten the interiority of its other.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The enfolding and overlapping between the
two domains means that ‘each is contained in the other as its <i>otherness-to-itself</i>’,
or its unconscious<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:
footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></a>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Here Felman now makes her statement, that by
nature of the two domains enfolding within each other, each informing and
displacing each other, because there are no natural boundaries, if
‘psychoanalysis points to the unconscious of literature’, and the ‘conscious’ in
literature forms the basis of psychoanalytical case studies, literature
therefore takes place as the ‘unconscious’ basis functioning behind
psychoanalytic theory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In <i>To Open the
Question</i>, Felman articulates her own standpoint by adopting Lacanian visions
of psychoanalysis (and of the analyst)<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2'
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></a>:
‘for Lacan, indeed, the unconscious is not only <i>that which must be read</i>,
but also, and primarily, <i>that which reads</i>’ (p.118).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Therefore the reader adopts the role of the
analyst on interpreting (and understanding) the text <i>consciously</i>, but
also adopts the role of the analysand in the process of transference from the
text to the <i>unconscious</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>James’s
novel is primarily a useful text to consider in light of this model of reading
precisely because of what is left open and understated for the
unconscious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The <i>open </i>nature of
the text means it represents a power struggle for the reader; it was designed,
in James’s own words, as ‘an <i>amusette</i> to catch those not easily caught’
(<i>cited in </i>Felman, 1982:102).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Subsequent critical readings into the <i>ambiguities</i> of the text
have resulted in unwitting participation in the text; the trap set by James has
resulted in re-enactments of the main conflicts indicated by the text.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In other words: the scene of the critical
debates surrounding the text, have resembled repetitions of the conflicts
within the text.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So what happens in <i>Turn
of the Screw</i>?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ambiguities in the
text (and we can also consider these later in terms of authorial and analytical
‘authority’) are reflected in our response to it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Here Felman asks the potent question: ‘are reading and ambiguity
in any way <i>compatible</i>?’ (p.117).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>With this statement in mind: is a reading of <i>Turn of the Screw</i>
therefore possible without a performance of the same debates and conflicts thrown
up by the text?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Lapanche and Pontalis
describe the compulsion to repeat as ‘an ungovernable process originating in
the unconscious’ (1973:78).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As Freud
explains: ‘a thing which has not been understood inevitably reappears; like an
unlaid ghost, it cannot rest until the mystery has been solved and the spell
broken’ (<i>ibid</i>.79).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So when
Felman observes that the scene of the critical debate is a repetition of the
debate at stake in the text (<i>i.e.</i> it mirrors that in James’s story), the
apparent ‘trap’ becomes clearly visible; any debate surrounding <i>Turn of the
Screw</i> is therefore bound to replicate the debates and conflicts in the
novel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Textual ambiguities doom its
critics as the process of transference takes place from text to
subconscious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Through a reading of the
text, the text acts itself out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Felman
explains: ‘Indeed it is not so much the critic who comprehends the text, as the
text which comprehends the critic’ (1982:115).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Authority is an
issue of concern to Felman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Critics
call upon the work of Freud as an authority for psychoanalysis (although this I
will later argue has changed in the light of Lacanian analysis), and James’s
authority exists as the author of the novel and consequently the authority
responsible for the opening of the debates surrounding his text.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Is our approach to both authors somehow
different?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Does James’s text allow us
to answer for James?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Does Freud’s text
allow us to answer for him?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When
considering questions concerning authority, these can only be addressed in
terms of ‘the act of reading and of interpretation’ (ibid:116).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Freud’s authority, Felman argues, unlike
James’s, is given weight by both Freudian and anti-Freudians; by configuring
themselves in polar opposition over James’s ‘true meaning’ they are demonstrating
agreement over the [ambiguous] ‘true meaning’ of Freud.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As a result, both viewpoints can be seen as
‘Freudian’ precisely because they are attacking Freud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There is a
linguistic irony functioning here: that Freud’s ghost haunts both opposing
critical viewpoints.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Reference to Freud
can only exist in terms of reference, by this I mean they use Freud’s name to
back their arguments.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They do not,
however, use Freud’s psychoanalytical ‘authority’ because, as Felman points
out, ‘the “true Freud” is no more immediately accessible to us than the “true
James”’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Freud’s ‘texts’, like James’s
novel, convey ‘not an established truth or a referential <i>knowledge</i>, but
an <i>invitation to interpretation</i>’ (<i>ibid.</i>).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Any Freudian reading can only be a reading
of Freud’s knowledge, an interpretation, and as Freud lays himself open to
criticism, by virtue of the speculative nature of his work, so any reading of
Freud must equally find itself ‘threatened by error’ (<i>ibid.</i>).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Therefore ‘Freudian’ reading is always at
risk of distorting Freud’s work because the circumstances in which Freud wrote
cannot be the same as the circumstances in which it is used to map onto an
[wild] analysis of any other body of literature.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>So any Freudian reading can be justified as a truth, ‘but no truer
than the opposed positions which contradict it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>And it is “false,” indeed, to the extent that it <i>excludes </i>them’
(<i>ibid.</i>117).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To illustrate
another of issues raised around what Felman criticises as Freudian ‘wild’
analysis of <i>Turn of the Screw</i>, I’d like to draw upon a letter written to
Freud by Jung.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After several years of
ongoing correspondence (and friendship) between Freud and Jung, Jung is finally
moved to telling Freud what he <i>really </i>thinks of his practices.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have no exact date for the letter, but my
guess is it’s <i>circa </i>late 1912:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>I am objective enough to see through your little trick.
You go about sniffing out all the symptomatic actions in your vicinity, thus
reducing everyone to the level of sons and daughters who blushingly admit the
existence of their faults. Meanwhile you remain on top as the father, sitting
pretty. For sheer obsequiousness nobody dares to pluck the prophet by the beard
and inquire for once what you would say to a patient with a tendency to analyze
the analyst instead of himself. You would certainly ask him: &quot;who's got
the neurosis?&quot; (McGuire, 1974:534-535).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This quote can be
considered important because like Lacan, Jung notices fundamental flaws in
Freud’s way of working.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In relation to <i>Turn
of the Screw</i>, this seems to be largely to do with the effects of
transference.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Lacan was largely
interested in the process of transference: the object relation in the act of
psychoanalysis between the analyst and analysand.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Freud, it seems has failed to recognise the depth at which
transference operates.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This, it could
be argued, is perhaps the major stumbling block for Wilson’s <i>violent</i>
Freudian analysis of <i>Turn of the Screw</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The argument Jung poses to Freud, mirrors the argument held by critics
over Wilson’s interpretation; it offers a ‘reductive’ interpretation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Lacan’s theories
furthered Freud’s cause by offering a re-reading of Freud; he accepts Freud’s
invitation to interpret his body of work and by doing so, shifts emphasis from
the sole authority of Freud.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the light
of Lacan’s work, it has perhaps now become difficult to think about the
authority – and scientific credibility (or truth) - behind Freudian
analysis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Transference is acknowledged
to be ‘the terrain on which all the basic problems of a given analysis play
themselves out’ (Laplanche and Pontalis, 1973:455), and Lacan has brought to
the forefront the structural issues of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>[Freudian] psychoanalysis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Lacan’s studies (and subsequent development) of the process of
transference ensure that ‘authority’ (in the psychoanalytic sense) is not
solely confined to one figure in the relationship between analyst and
analysand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So upon reading
psychoanalysis through Lacan’s work, Felman’s essay becomes essentially a case
study in literary transference.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Felman attributes
the aggressive dialectic of the opposing critics to James’s moments of
ambiguity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Her poetic criticism of the
critics’ views functions by means of a dialetic of violence that she constructs
from their own language, which she then traces historically to what James
refers to as his ‘trap’, as the root cause.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Felman cites initial reactions to the novel, emphasising the vehement,
aggressive tone of the critical dialectic deployed as ‘hopelessly evil’ or
‘distinctly repulsive’ by ‘helping to debauch … the pure and trusting nature of
children’ (1982:96).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Wilson’s so-called
Freudian reading of the text later arouses similar critical derision; he is
criticised in how he ‘<i>does violence</i>’ to the novel (p.98) and must
therefore be ‘<i>attacked</i> point-by-point’ (p.99).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>So when Douglas reminds his initial audience that the story won’t
tell everything in ‘any literal vulgar way’, the authority of Wilson’s Freudian
analysis is finally crushed, or to quote another critic: ‘completely <i>defeated</i>’
(<i>Ibid.)</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The vulgarity, perhaps
exists in the violent language bandied by undoubtedly intelligent and <i>literate</i>
critics: ‘and this Jamesian commentary seems to be suggesting that such a
reading might indeed be inaccurate not so much because it is incorrect or
false, but because it is, in James’s terms, <i>vulgar</i>’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The creation of
psychoanalysis creates a model for the suggestion of how other structures might
have been examined.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These are
ultimately metonymic discourses, where external structures of thought are
built, which attempt to describe internal structures.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Psychoanalysis can (and perhaps should) be seen as a
meta-language: it is a system based on a pre-existing system (language).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Psychoanalysis is a set of tools, built upon
existing literature and myth, the metonymic, the unconscious of
literature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the light of literary
transference, Felman’s proposal is clear: her reading is an attempt ‘not so
much to <i>capture </i>the mystery’s solution, but to follow, rather, the
significant path of its flight’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>To
understand the rhetorical functioning of textual ambiguity: ‘not “<i>what</i>
does the story mean?” but rather “<i>how</i> does the story mean”’, to examine
the effect of ambiguous literature and its effect of ‘permanent displacement’
on the unconscious.</p>

<h1>Commentary on Feedback</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The feedback advice I was given for this piece was some of the
most useful I had ever received for a single piece of work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Good feedback, I felt, deserved some kind of
response, so here are a few comments on one particular comment.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I could offer comments on several of the
comments made, but soon the length this commentary would outstrip the essay
itself…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘<i>dealing in philosophy of interpretation</i>’:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As I read (and later re-read) many of last
term’s set readings, further readings and readings I found for the course, I
noticed that much of what was done with the texts involved a degree of ‘word-play’
on behalf of the writers concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It
wasn’t so much what was said, but the ways in which things could be said in
order to make a point more concretely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In the light of the texts investigating Lacanian psychoanalysis, his Sassurian
<i>semiotic</i> approach to re-reading Freud (also, Felman’s re-reading of
Lacan, and therefore Wright’s re-reading of Felman’s re-reading of Lacan and so
on.), involved (in certain respects) perhaps not saying a lot more than Freud
(cf: Stam <i>et al.</i> on Lacan’s re-reading of Freud’s reading of the child’s
game of <i>fort/da</i>), but using language to re-situate Freud’s own interpretation
of the scene.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It wasn’t necessarily
that the points he addressed were that much more astute than those made by Freud
(in my opinion, of course), but his use of language to sew up the point Freud
was making <i>was</i> - I felt - far more astute.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Perhaps the major difference between Freud and Lacan (and dare I
make such a bold statement this early on?) then, is that Lacan’s work is <i>packaged</i>
in such a way that it <i>invites </i>readings on a multitude of levels.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One sentence can have several dimensions of
meaning, depending on where it is approached from...<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
More simplistically: what are the differences between discover and dis-cover;
represent and re-present.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the
surface, very little, as both words mean the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The difference lies in the way the writer is suggesting the word should
be read; from where I look at it, the hyphen reminds me that the word ‘discover’
can be taken as two words and the hyphen makes that explicit (something that
the eye may perhaps miss if the word is not hyphenated).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Discover is a negation of a familiar word:
cover.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Likewise ‘represent’, suggests an
object, which is used to symbolise another object (<i>in film</i> (and in some
respects, literature, also) this is often referred to as <i>symbolism</i> and <i>iconography</i>
is denoted by a collection of <i>symbols</i> and this is how generic
stereotypes are surely built up: eg: the saloon doors in the Western).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Add the hyphen and we remember that it is a
presentation that has taken place before and is taking place again <i>re-present</i>.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I could literally go on all day just by looking
further into these two words.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although this was <i>not</i> something I mentioned in my
log, the first term’s readings have been memorable in the ways in which they
have - in all honesty - <i>completely reshaped</i> the way I now examine most situations
(be they arguments, films, literature, everyday character interactions or
whatever), in the light of looking at layers of meaning in what is said and how
that ‘meaning’ may be interpreted depending on the stance adopted by the
interpreter. </p>

style='font-size:10.0pt'>Lacan’s theories emerged through his experience as a
training analyst.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His research is
largely a result of his own dissatisfaction with the ambiguities found in
Freud’s work, so as a training analyst he developed his own textual comparisons
and remarks to deal with the practical experience of transference within his
own work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Felman therefore surely
acknowledges a debt to Lacan’s work.</span></p>
