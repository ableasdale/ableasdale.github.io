  and the ‘New’ Music Industry</b></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">‘The 
  Internet is neither a panacea nor a threat for the music industry - the threat 
  is complacency. (…) the music industry cannot afford to take the success of 
  the UK digital economy for granted. (…) [The government must act quickly to

<p>  On January 17th this year, popular tabloid <i>The Mirror</i> hailed the acronym 
  ‘mp3’ as the Internet's most popular search term<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""> 
  [3] </a>, which they suggested was surely a sign of the Internet finally ‘growing 
  up’ (<i>The Mirror</i>, 17th Jan: 13).  At varying times throughout the previous 
  year, an ongoing race between ‘sex’ and ‘mp3’ for first place was charted by 
  several publications<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""> [4] </a> and the term itself became in many respects, 
  subject to the close and dedicated monitoring of search engines<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""> [5] </a>, who it seemed, began watching its every move 
  by the minute.  The phenomenon of mp3, itself little more than an obscure compression 
  codec from Germany<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""> [6] </a>, has been subject to similar 
  attention and exposure in <i>online</i> news as the fiercely debated notion 
  of Internet and pornography, as covered by existing media.  Clearly both have 
  been a source of intrigue, whilst producing moments of crisis for existing national 
  laws.  Both events, perhaps by virtue of their controversial carrier medium, 
  have hailed the need for significant changes in policy; changes that have seemingly 
  allowed the technology to take the law into its own hands, pulling the wool 
  over the eyes of the existing agencies who sought to <i>protect </i>a public 
  for what they were about to see – before they saw it.  In both cases, the technology 
  beat the policy makers by a clear distance and neither debate is near being 
  closed.  It is my intention to examine a selection of the debates surrounding 
  the .mp3 compression format, in an attempt to demonstrate an understanding of 
  its role in the creation of a new market, the subsequent need for a reformatting 
  of old legislation and its challenging of long-standing historical assumptions 
  held within the music industry and by those who contribute to it: musicians 
  themselves.</p>
<p>  Before this debate is moved any further, a few significant claims (or assumptions) 
  must be cut into the grooves.  Firstly, I believe the network of the music industry 
  to be chiefly concerned with the technologies (<i>as</i> techniques) of <i>reproduction 
  </i>and <i>distribution</i>.  Here its <i>reproduction</i> functions <i>par 
  excellence </i>involve the recording, production and mastering of sound signals 
  onto a medium for mass-distribution.  Here, <i>distribution</i> works in terms 
  of the availability of the product (in shops) and in its coverage (<i>in</i> 
  print media,<i> </i>radio, film and television).  The Internet, I think, is 
  precisely concerned with fast and efficient <i>reproduction</i> and <i>distribution</i> 
  of bits over networked areas.  If we think of both the Internet and the music 
  industry as striving to meet similar ends (the former in terms of <i>mechanical 
  mass production</i>, the latter in terms of <i>mass electronic reproduction</i>), 
  then the debate is mobilised over the degree to which latter developments had 
  over the existence of the former.  Where the .mp3<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""> 
  [7] </a> compression technique is concerned, however, the debate concerns file-size.  
  Quite simply, layer-3 compression, through a technique called ‘psychoacoustic 
  masking’<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""> [8] </a> (<i>New Scientist</i>, 
  19-6-99:34), enables a significant step-down in the size of a stored digitised 
  (<i>or</i> ‘sampled’) waveform (<i>as in</i> that from a CD); uncompressed a 
  3-minute CD track sampled at its correct frequency, takes up around 30 megabytes.  
  With layer-3 compression, the track is reduced to less than 3 megabytes (<i>Ibid.</i>) 
  with minimal degradation in sound quality.  Through a combined study of <i>elements</i> 
  of music industry history and some recent case studies surrounding the applications 
  of layer-3 (mp3) compression, it is my intention to examine the some of the 
  ruptures this compression technique has caused, in the wake of increased bandwidth, 
  storage capacity and the general downsizing of technology, within the existing 
  music industry network.</p>
<p><b>History: The Growth of the Music Industry</b></p>
<p>  In <i>Performing Rites</i>, Simon Frith (1996) offers a perspective on the 
  ‘authority’ of technology over music.  His analysis effectively covers musical 
  ‘production’ and ‘reproduction’, although Frith offers no detailed exposition 
  of the significant recent changes in methods of <i>distribution</i>; perhaps 
  this is because his work was written <i>before</i> the development of .mp3 compression 
  and certainly before artists themselves had openly expressed interest in the 
  virtues of computer networking as a viable means of reaching - and trading with 
  - their fans<a href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9" title=""> [9] </a>.  Frith does, however identify three distinct 
  historical moments of organisation around technologies of musical ‘storage’ 
  and ‘retrieval’.  In the first moment, Frith considers the ‘folk’ stage: where 
  the music is stored in both body and instruments, only retrieved in rituals 
  of performance (1996:226).  Here music was integrated into everyday social practices 
  (<i>as </i>work-songs or lullabies) or cordoned off from the everyday as a ceremonial 
  event (as a narrative story).  The second stage he identifies as the ‘art’ stage: 
  here music is ‘stored’ through its notation.  Similarly, retrieval occurs in 
  performance (<i>Ibid.</i>227), although a distinction is now postulated dividing 
  the ‘ritual’ and the ‘cultural’: ‘the musical mind is thus elevated over the 
  musical body’ (<i>Ibid.</i>).  Here Frith acknowledges a shift between the ‘mode’ 
  of folk towards a structural ‘aesthetic’ appreciation of music: in his first 
  model, stories are passed on through a medium of human observation; hence popular 
  folk ballads are re-elaborated by each new performer’s take on the piece, perhaps 
  often recalled from memory or extrapolated from earlier teachings.  </p>
<p>  Frith’s ‘art’ stage motions toward the integration of a <i>standard</i> grammar 
  (or syntax) into conventions of storage: here Frith’s ‘art’ stage acknowledges 
  a notion of authorship, where a composer - by virtue of the conventions of notation 
  - produces a manuscript encapsulating a blue-print (or framework) within which 
  their work can be interpreted.  In this stage, then, a re-elaboration of the 
  folk ballad is replaced by an <i>interpretive</i> reading by the scholar with 
  a surmounting knowledge of the theory of notation (and the <i>essence </i>of 
  the piece is mapped for the performer by the mathematical [mechanical] principals 
  of notation theory).  Although Frith makes no attempt to incorporate any historical 
  rubric (or schemata) into his division of these stages, I use his ‘art’ stage 
  to argue that notation brought with it the ‘composer/artist’; that the formulation 
  of music into standard notation brought with it the recognition of the ‘author’ 
  as the creator of the piece<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""> [10] 
  </a>.  In performance terms, however, the meaning of the notated ‘text’ is by 
  no means fixed; becoming subject to the interpretation of the performer, who 
  considers the notation in accordance with a host of other parameters: sympathy 
  with the composer, control of the instrument and notational understanding.</p>
<p>  For Frith, the third stage - the ‘pop’ stage – saw technological processes 
  of mechanical [re]-production and distribution as allowing for the <i>mobility</i> 
  and availability of music.  This, I would argue is where conventions of copyright 
  were first placed onto music<a href="#_ftn11"
name="_ftnref11" title=""> [11] </a>, alongside notions of ownership (the right 
  for the artist to be recognised as ‘creator’ and for the publisher as ‘owner’ 
  of its copyright).  In this stage, the ‘material experience of music’ (<i>Ibid.</i>) 
  transformed the piece into a commodity (as object or possession).  Here music 
  is captured (<i>produced</i>), stored on a mass-replicable medium (phonogram, 
  disc or tape) for retrieval via a suitable decoding medium (stylus, laser or 
  magnetic ‘head’).  Subsequently, the <i>performance</i> element (and the <i>live</i> 
  spontaneity of the first two stages) is now subjected to the practices of technological 
  production; for the artist, perfection (through takes, splicing etc.) can be 
  now achieved in a studio, in a quest for the perfect cut.  Through citations 
  of an interview with Glenn Gould in 1966, Frith remarks that new developments 
  in technological reproduction ‘set aside the usual “hazards and compromises” 
  of concert performance’ (<i>Ibid.</i>), and greater degrees of precision became 
  part of studio technique.  Over time, increased <i>studio</i> use of magnetic 
  tape articulated a shift from the ‘art’ stage of mastering (or capturing) a 
  live ‘recording’ into a process of editing ‘records of ideal, not real, events 
  (Frith 1987:65).</p>
<p>  If we are to adopt Frith’s three stages, then it is my suggestion that a 
  new wave of digital technologies are articulating a space for a possible fourth 
  stage; all processing is computer-aided from the stages of studio capture (with 
  digital mixing, digital sample editing, sequencing <i>and</i> storage), through 
  to performance (MIDI interfacing between digital instruments and ‘live’ sequencing 
  of digital samples).  As Paul Brindley’s <i>IPPR </i>report suggests: in the 
  wake of an imminent ‘fully networked environment’, the music industry must strive 
  daily to achieve an ultimate end game where the ‘seamless delivery of music’ 
  is fully incorporated into the process of music distribution (2000:i).  On both 
  sides of the fence, general changes in operation within the industry are needed 
  in order for the alleviation of the current <i>fear</i> of damage caused by 
  piracy, itself resulting from changes both in hardware and software. The role 
  of the musician/artist/composer will also be redefined in light of this: initial 
  understandings of both instrument and notation will be accompanied by a surmounting 
  knowledge of digital production practices and digital sequencing skills.  For 
  an industry now primarily concerned with technologies of electronic [re]-production, 
  both content and delivery are in a state of transition as I hope to demonstrate 
  through case studies.  In consideration of <i>new</i> changes, it is vital to 
  consider the ways in which the industry has <i>developed</i>; an historical 
  study demonstrates a repetition of similar forms of upheaval and destabilisation; 
  patterns of change have duly occurred in the contexts of musical <i>content</i> 
  and <i>delivery</i>, however for the majority of this discussion, my emphasis 
  will largely focus upon the latter aspect. </p>
<p>  In terms of ‘pop’ <i>content</i>, then, several writers have acknowledged 
  the partial shift of music towards an amalgamation of the ‘familiar’ and the 
  ‘new’ into the body of the song.  In <i>Will Pop Eat Itself?</i> Beadle (1993) 
  considers the growth of the new waves of pop music, focusing his enquiry on 
  the emergence of the artists of the ‘soundbite era’ who utilise digital sampling/editing 
  to create ‘new’ structures from groups of ‘familiar’ sounds.  The development 
  of digital audio capture and sequencing changed the parameters within which 
  these musicians worked; here one of Beadle’s numerous examples is the growth 
  of the 1980s band <i>Pop Will Eat Itself</i> and their use of the digital sampler 
  to create music ‘collages’<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""> [12] 
  </a> by cutting and pasting from the old and familiar.  This has lead to haphazard 
  forms of music, whose origins can perhaps best be traced to what Baudrillard 
  termed a ‘free floating mix of signifiers’<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"
title=""> [13] </a>, or, as Mark Poster’s ‘third stage’ of human history explains, 
  the displacement of the representational character of language, which has led 
  to a cutting (or a displacement) of the ‘referent’ from language, rendering 
  the subject/self ‘decentred, dispersed, and multiplied in continuous instability’ 
  (1990:5).  As the ‘pop’ landscape that Frith describes converges with digital 
  technology, new representations of pop become available: digital music is accompanied 
  by digital pop videos, A&amp;R finds new terrains for talent scouting in home-brew 
  demos and videos made available on the Internet.  Fan sites amass online and 
  following in the footsteps of Lara Croft, virtual pop stars are being produced 
  and tested<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"
title=""> [14] </a>.  </p>
<p>  As Walter Benjamin explains, technology moves us ‘toward a certain form of 
  art’ (1955/1992:242).  One of art’s foremost tasks, he argues, has <i>always 
  </i>entailed a continual process of working towards the ‘creation of a demand 
  which could be fully satisfied only later’ (<i>Ibid.</i>230).  We can see, perhaps 
  without moving too briskly towards an exposition of the historical stages involved 
  in this process<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""> [15] </a>, that 
  one of the most prevalent factors crystallising ‘the .mp3 debate’ is precisely 
  that a new satisfaction of demand is being created: only one where a <i>domestic 
  </i>technological development has <i>temporarily</i> authorised the bypassing 
  of many of the music industry’s own channels, illuminating the need for it’s 
  own (arguably perhaps imminent) re-evaluation<a
href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""> [16] </a>.  Before I progress, two significant 
  points must be brought to light: firstly that the present debate reproduces 
  an earlier moment in music history: a similar moment of crisis, occurring with 
  the introduction of the C90 audiotape, which unleashed a subsequent fear throughout 
  the industry that mass-music piracy was about to erupt.  Throughout its incubation 
  period, vinyl albums were frequently printed with a logo of a cassette and crossbones, 
  sporting the words ‘Home Taping is Killing Music’<a
href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""> [17] </a>.  Secondly, that such repetition 
  of effect can come into play within the industry, only to be re-iterated at 
  a later stage by the next consumer ‘liberating’ technology prompts us to the 
  question the <i>nature</i> of the music industry.  By nature, the music industry 
  has always been chiefly concerned with technologies of <i>reproduction</i> and 
  <i>distribution</i>; and as ‘new’ technologies (or new software) are developed 
  (or made available) for the consumer market, the music industry – in order to 
  survive – clearly must remain several steps ahead.  As Brindley’s proposal argues 
  at outset, three new models of music distribution must be set into place, all 
  to be implemented at different stages on the route towards a fully on-line music 
  industry<a href="#_ftn18"
name="_ftnref18" title=""> [18] </a> (<i>See </i>Brindley, 2000)</p>
<p>  In <i>Illuminations</i>, Benjamin argued that film, as a new technology, 
  was important in part because it involved ‘the liquidation of the traditional 
  value of the cultural heritage’. (1955/1992:215).  The Internet, primarily a 
  technology concerned with effective <i>distribution</i> of information<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"
title=""> [19] </a>, is important as a new technology in part, precisely because 
  it involves <i>the liquidation of the traditional value</i> of the ‘cultural 
  heritage’ of music.  Essentially these remarks reflect Aragon and Sampaio’s 
  (1998:153-4) argument that the new ‘mode of information’ produced by digital 
  technology acts as a ‘reductive’ force, <i>insofar as</i> the shift from analogue 
  to digital articulates a separation of the imitation of both ‘the [instrument] 
  sound’ and a ‘sense of the recording moment’.  Digital mastery, by virtue of 
  the re-sampling of an analogue tape (which was present at the time of ‘conception’) 
  and re-mapping into a chain of binary digits, harbours a differing set of values 
  for their audience; perhaps as a ‘third-step’ process of filtering from Benjamin’s 
  <i>unique</i> art object (that with ‘aura’) to the mechanically reproduced object, 
  to the digitally re-mastered mechanical product.  Although in many respects 
  I find Aragon and Sampaio’s observation holds <i>some</i> weight, I believe 
  there is a degree to which this is true – and they admit this – is there really 
  that much difference between hearing the same song on vinyl, then on CD?  For 
  most, I’d suspect, there would be little difference, however their arguments 
  are framed within a discussion of gender differences in on-line ‘chat spaces’.  
  In relation to the physical <i>presence</i> or <i>absence</i> of a person (rather 
  than placement of an analogue recording device in the studio), the division 
  between ‘real space’ and ‘chat space’ (or between <i>body </i>and <i>avatar</i>) 
  invokes <i>real</i> notions of difference<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""> 
  [20] </a>; we could equally draw this comparison in relation to difference in 
  perceptions of <i>temporality</i> between telephone and letter as culturally 
  both mediums signify in different ways. </p>
<p>  MPEG Layer 3 [.mp3] compression, then, can be distinguished as a representative 
  exemplifier, as an enabling factor for a process of <i>liquidation</i> (of the 
  ‘traditional value’ of music) to take place.  As the cultural heritage of music 
  is thus redefined (along digital lines), its’ notion of ‘traditional value’ 
  is duly redefined, perhaps now ordered as a series of <i>selective</i> catalogues 
  (in much the same way as the ‘classic’ radio stations, who serve their listeners 
  with an historically-selective range of ‘oldie’ songs).  In this respect, individual 
  songs - despite a uniformity of format (<i>.mp3: 44Hz, 128Bps</i>) - are unequal 
  in terms of ‘server presence’ as some (the more famous) will be featured more 
  than others.  On reflection, Benjamin uses mass-produced historical texts – 
  and more importantly, their filmic ‘takes’ on historic moments – to best illustrate 
  the process of liquidation<a href="#_ftn21"
name="_ftnref21" title=""> [21] </a>.  Regarding .mp3, then, this process seems 
  to have curiously taken up a <i>different</i> form of liquidation: that of the 
  ‘traditional value’ of the music industry itself.  Although I <i>do</i> believe 
  that layer 3 compression allows us to think about music in truly new ways, I 
  am less inclined to subscribe to the ‘doomsday scenario’ offered by Culture 
  Secretary Chris Smith (<i>see </i>footnote #11); while there can be no doubt 
  that his statistics offer a representation of the <i>scale</i> of .mp3 distribution, 
  we should remember that thousands of CD players are still sold<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""> 
  [22] </a>, although this is complicated by the fact that CD-R media is becoming 
  more commonplace and therefore a sharp rise in sales of CD ‘players’ could be 
  attributed to the rise in CD-R units sold.  Also, as Hi-Fi ‘accessories’ wear, 
  from experience, it seems as if the majority of CD players manufactured seem 
  to break faster than any other component.  Although I have no statistical evidence 
  to support this, I have noticed that popular Hi-Fi store <i>Richer Sounds</i> 
  charges more for 3-year ‘super-care cover’ over these devices.  Finally, a new 
  wave of Hi-Fi recording devices (CD-R, MiniDisc, DCC) are now available and 
  these units often have a digital input for recording data straight from CD.  
  Subsequently, CD players without digital ‘outputs’ would be need to be replaced 
  by home users wishing to ‘cash in’ on any of these new technologies.</p>
<p><b>CDs: The Death of Vinyl?</b></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">‘New 
  media supplement, rather than replace, the old’ (Collins and Murroni, 1996:141)</font></p>
<p>  One of the key debates surrounding the CD was that it was smaller and tougher 
  than vinyl.  However, this redefined vinyl’s role as the DJ’s medium and sales 
  of <i>technics </i>turntables in the past five years, for example, have shown 
  no signs of weakening<a
href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""> [23] </a>.  Indeed, Thornton (1995:47) 
  remarks upon the growth of ‘disc-dance’ venues in the 1980s as being an exemplary 
  indicator of trends in youth-culture.  With specific reference to the development 
  of CDs, she discusses the generally-perceived receptions gleaned from the two 
  formats: CDs on the one hand, were seen as ‘cold’, ‘clinical’ and ‘inhuman’ 
  whereas Vinyl seemed so frequently to be diametrically opposed to this format: 
  the vinyl DJ was often considered an ‘artist’ and a ‘musician’ working with 
  a ‘warm’ and ‘real’ medium, as opposed to the ‘technician’ working with the 
  laser and aluminium. (<i>Ibid.</i>64).</p>
<p>   Fascinatingly, then, the emergence of the hyper-piracy-friendly medium of 
  .mp3, seems to chime in with a documented increase in sales of Compact Discs<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""> 
  [24] </a>.  Although this can be partially explained by Collins and Murroni’s 
  <i>IPPR</i> report, it can also be attributed to economic factors and, perhaps 
  primarily to a general growth in e-commerce ‘entertainment’ sales, with the 
  upstart of companies such as Amazon.  The introduction of commercial CD-R units 
  would equally warrant a growth in CD-R sales; can we draw a distinction between 
  sale of the two formats (both of which are CDs) and how frequently is a distinction 
  drawn between audio CDs and CD-ROMs?</p>
<p><b><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'>Case Study I: Super Media? The Convergence 
  of EMI, Time Warner and AOL</span></b></p>
<p>  In the wake of the merger between Universal and Polygram earlier last year, 
  EMI announced their plans to merge with Time Warner just two weeks after the 
  latter announced their merger with AOL.  The successful merger of both the British 
  EMI with the US Time Warner, together worth an estimated $20bn<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""> 
  [25] </a>, would guarantee to create the world’s largest music company while 
  reducing the ‘big five’ Keith Negus identified as owning 70 per cent of the 
  recorded popular music sold in the world<a href="#_ftn26"
name="_ftnref26" title=""> [26] </a> into four key players.  Indeed the late 1980s 
  and early 1990s were a time ‘of frenetic merger and acquisition activity in 
  the music related industries’ (Negus, 1992:4), although in the late 1990s, what 
  came to constitute ‘music related’ would also cover computer-related ‘interactive’ 
  media companies.  In the US, online music sales are projected to grow ‘more 
  than tenfold in the next five years, to more than $2 billion annually’<a
href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""> [27] </a>.  Such a significant statistic 
  has undoubtedly set the tone for a next-wave of mergers, as Negus observes, 
  the term synergy ‘refers to a strategy of diversifying into directly related 
  technologies and areas of entertainment and using the opportunities that this 
  provides for extending the exposure of specific pieces of music and artists’ 
  (Negus, 1992:5).  In part, synergies also function on a technological level; 
  perhaps this merger proves this.  Convergence, it could be argued, is now reaching 
  a stage where potential exists for computer software, video, discs and tapes 
  to be combined and used on one multimedia self-contained home entertainment 
  system; Time Warner, for example, set aside $500m last year to invest in new 
  online efforts, before opting for the tried and tested techniques offered by 
  the services gained from its merger with AOL<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""> 
  [28] </a>, in addition to an amalgamation of customer services and client details.</p>
<p>  Historically, such merging is not unusual for media companies.  In the case 
  of the music industry, larger ‘umbrella’ companies with wider interests own 
  many of the companies (<i>See </i>Negus, 1992:2).  For many companies, large 
  or small, the developments articulated by new e-commerce markets lie high on 
  business agendas.  In terms of the ‘online entertainment’ sector, the arrival 
  of broadband technology lies at the heart of the e-commerce ‘<i>revolution</i>’.  
  With specific reference to digital audio, moving vast quantities of such content 
  over the web will not be possible, likely <i>or</i> desirable while the majority 
  of Internet users are dialling in on a 56Kb (or slower) modem. Perhaps this 
  factor is what made the AOL-Time Warner merger such a perfect combination<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""> 
  [29] </a>.  EMI recently predicted that 10% of its sales would be generated 
  via the Internet within five years and had already begun making investments 
  in a series of web-based music firms<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""> 
  [30] </a>.  The combination of the three companies, it has been argued, ‘makes 
  sense’ geographically: for its influence and coverage over both the US (Warner) 
  and the UK (EMI), for a global market-share of 20% of the music industry<a href="#_ftn31"
name="_ftnref31" title=""> [31] </a>, and, most importantly, to enable the acceleration 
  of the convergence digital distribution platforms across all media<a
href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""> [32] </a>.  The merger works on several 
  levels and it is perhaps worthy of a brief discussion of the mutual benefits 
  gained by the amalgamation (<i>convergence</i>) of these companies into a global 
  corporation with a powerful ‘online’ presence.  The key is that EMI Warner are 
  granted a huge new potential customer base from the 26 million people who subscribe 
  to AOL<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""> [33] </a> to have them (as 
  the world's biggest internet service provider) guide them through cyberspace.  
  Combined, EMI Warner has a strong customer basis for its vast multinational 
  portfolio of musicians and artists.  The potential for providing almost limitless 
  entertainment via the Internet has perhaps been the topic of discussion for 
  some time, but it seems this is the year when the business world will start 
  to make it happen.</p>
<p>  However, it faces significant problems it must first overcome: issues concerning 
  intellectual property online and, perhaps more significantly, <i>security</i>.  
  Both of these issues will be re-employed for my final case studies.  As Brindley 
  suggests, the key driver for change in the digital economy is technological 
  convergence (2000:13), a ‘process by which previously distinct information delivery 
  systems appear seamless from the end user’s perspective’ (<i>Ibid.</i>). This 
  <i>combined </i>merger provides further evidence that a digital economy is looming, 
  although at present, MPEG layer-3 technology <i>fails</i> to provide adequate 
  security measures to endorse this process; a digital economy is only worth what 
  a consumer is willing to pay for it, and mp3, while liberating for consumers, 
  semi-professional musicians and music hobbyists alike, lacks any security stringent 
  enough to allow <i>real </i>e-commerce transactions to take place.  However, 
  with the slow reactions from within industry, problems are beginning to occur.  
  There are several ‘secure’ formats in development at present<a href="#_ftn34"
name="_ftnref34" title=""> [34] </a> and a universal agenda - the Secure Digital 
  Music Initiative (SDMI) - has been set into place by the ‘big five’.  Amendments 
  have been made to the copyright act<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""> 
  [35] </a>, although these tend to look like they protect the record company’s 
  interests rather than individual artists.  Of all the formats available, I have 
  selected two which look like they <i>may</i> be feasible alternatives to the 
  by now standard, mp3.  Firstly, Microsoft has a rival format – as an extension 
  to their Windows Media Player 4 suite<a href="#_ftn36"
name="_ftnref36" title=""> [36] </a> - which they argue is secure, of higher quality 
  and smaller than mp3.  By virtue of Microsoft’s ‘brand name’, its power and 
  influence, this format is a possible future ‘standard’, one that can be utilised 
  now.  However, Brindley (2000:14) mentions one other format for which limited 
  technical specifications are already available<a href="#_ftn37"
name="_ftnref37" title=""> [37] </a>: MPEG7.  At the time of publication, little 
  is known about the format, but as a member of the MPEG-family, there is equal 
  promise for such a codec; both <i>allegedly</i> satisfy SDMI standards, although 
  meeting ‘security specifications’ is not a marker of overall infallibility.  
  I will return to a discussion of both codecs in later case studies.</p>
<p>  Secure Online Music will be, I think, an acid test for the ‘future’ of digital 
  distribution; the key issue at stake here is bandwidth.  As we move into higher-speed 
  broadband Internet access later this year, the success of the mp3 format clearly 
  demonstrates that music is particularly adaptable to this mode of delivery.  
  Firstly, it doesn't demand the bandwidth requirements that film or television 
  will expect, so it will be used as a template – a kind of beta test – in the 
  first-wave world of entertainment online.  There is no question that in a ‘technologically 
  weighted’ <i>Western </i>sense, music is a global phenomenon, and one that can 
  also be distributed into a broad array of devices.  Recently there has been 
  much consolidation within the ‘telecommunications’ sector; many companies have 
  combined forces and BT has just undergone a major shake-up to enable it to deal 
  with <i>service provision </i>for the emerging new forms of Interactive media, 
  many of which it will be ready to offer the existing network for.</p>
<p><b>Case Study II: The <i>Rio </i>Player – MP3 From Desktop to Walkman into 
  PDAs</b></p>
<p>  As Paul Brindley explains, digitisation is most easily understood as the 
  process of converting all information (text, audio, graphics and film) into 
  a language that is understood by computers (Brindley, 2000:13).  The combination 
  of digitisation with powerful compression techniques such as MPEG layer-3 have 
  partially implied wide-ranging consequences for the industry as a whole; these 
  have so far been represented in several legal battles; one such example can 
  be found in the study of Diamond Multimedia’s release of its <i>Rio</i> layer-3 
  decoding walkman<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""> [38] </a>.  Ithiel 
  De Sola Pool (1984) described the <i>then</i> new-wave of digital media as representative 
  of a potential shift in power, one that offered radical implications for the 
  consumer: these were called ‘technologies of freedom’.  Indeed, one of the fundamental 
  changes the Internet introduced was to make available inexpensive means for 
  publishing and distribution on a global scale.  This means that composers and 
  performers can produce music using home technologies<a
href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""> [39] </a> and that a distribution network 
  is set in place, <i>theoretically </i>allowing their products to be <i>distributed</i> 
  directly to their fans, effectively bypassing traditional music distribution 
  channels completely.  On the other hand, the ‘liberating’ aspects of the software 
  and hardware mean for those who believe that “information wants to be free” 
  have a perfect tool for piracy and the dissemination of bootleg copies of songs.  
  Needless to say, the music industry – and for the time being, it’s artists – 
  <i>are</i> concerned, and would like to see an end to all <i>unauthorised </i>mp3 
  activity.</p>
<p>  Before I launch into my case study I would like to consider some of the debates 
  surrounding (or alternatives to) mp3’s and security.  Brindley is quick to remind 
  us that ‘there are over 11 billion unprotected hard carrier sources in circulation 
  at present – in the form of CDs’ (2000:37).  Every audio CD in circulation contains 
  unencrypted, unprotected digital music that can be extracted or copied and converted 
  into computer audio files or copied onto another disc<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40"
title=""> [40] </a>.  Little can be done about these CDs – the audio data pressed 
  into them is completely susceptible to DAC (Digital Audio Code) ‘ripping’<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41"
title=""> [41] </a> through a multitude of open-source, shareware and commercial 
  digital audio readers<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""> [42] </a>.  
  Once the DAC information is extracted, hardware CD-R <i>or</i> CD-RW ‘burners’ 
  can be used along with almost <i>any</i> CD-Recorder software<a href="#_ftn43"
name="_ftnref43" title=""> [43] </a> to clone an ‘original’ audio CD, write the 
  extracted DAC code onto a CD-R as audio, or store a quantity of .mp3 files as 
  computer data.  If all this is taken into consideration, then there is, I think, 
  a genuine scenario for the music industry to consider: where do these new and 
  liberating technologies leave it now?  What is to be the role of <i>traditional 
  </i>music publishers and distributors?  This phenomenon has been called ‘disintermediation’ 
  (<i>See</i>:<i> </i>CSTB, 2000)<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""> 
  [44] </a>: the elimination of middlemen in transactions.  If authors, composers 
  and performers alike are able to publish and distribute online themselves, surely 
  publishers (as middlemen) are unnecessary?  Whenever we consider this debate, 
  we are always drawn back to the fact that the music industry is a long-standing 
  institution and functions in tandem with a variety of existing media.  Recently, 
  film soundtracks seem to have articulated their own space within the Top 40; 
  audiences watch the film then buy poster and CD.  If a radio station regularly 
  plays a song over a number of weeks, this is likely to reflect in both its popularity 
  and sales.  If anyone can <i>create</i> or <i>publish</i>, content will proliferate, 
  producing a condition of information overload.  The problem for the consumer 
  will not be to obtain, but to <i>filter</i> the deluge of information housed 
  by the content-rich world.  Clearly in light of this, the music industry <i>will 
  </i>need to redefine its own terms, although we can suspect many long-existing 
  parameters to remain embedded; in this sense the job of an A&amp;R representative 
  will remain the same: they will still be listening to demo-songs, only perhaps 
  online, rather than on tape or CD.  What is clear is that the emergence of a 
  rogue digital compression format has caused a crisis in identity for the present 
  music industry: it is therefore hardly surprising that battles are already emerging 
  over the future character of the industry.</p>
<p>   In October 1998, the <i>Recording Industry Association of America </i>(RIAA) 
  sued <i>Diamond Multimedia</i>, maker of the controversial <i>Rio</i> Walkman.  
  The suit purported to block the sale of the device.  The <i>Rio</i>, it argued, 
  had <i>violated </i>the Audio Home Recording Act (AHRA); the device did not 
  contain a serial copy management mechanism, meaning that copies, when made, 
  could be moved from a player back to a computer with no security concerns.  
  The appeals court upheld the case on the grounds that the <i>Rio</i> was strictly 
  a playback device (CSTB, 2000)<a href="#_ftn45"
name="_ftnref45" title=""> [45] </a> and there was no way of transferring information 
  from it to another ‘walkman’ device.  The AHRA ensures the right of consumers 
  to make audio recordings (<i>either</i> analogue copies <i>or</i> digital clones) 
  for private, non-commercial use (<i>Ibid.</i>).  The case of the <i>Rio</i> 
  solidified the first part of the legislative process for layer-3 digital walkmans, 
  whilst also highlighting key issues at the core of the debates surrounding digital 
  music.  Attacking the <i>Rio</i> for enabling easy .mp3 file transfer (and hence 
  piracy) has proven to be a futile exercise; the device alone is <i>unable</i> 
  to transfer files without the aid of a computer, which as a device, is conveniently 
  configured outside the influential parameters of the AHRA<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""> 
  [46] </a>.  In the case of the <i>Rio</i>, a second loophole was also exposed 
  by this case; that as a device it <i>could</i> be considered (from a consumer 
  perspective) as a technology which makes <i>portable</i>, or ‘space-shifts’ 
  files that already reside on a user’s hard disk: ‘Such copying is paradigmatic 
  non-commercial personal use entirely consistent with the purposes of the act’<a
href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""> [47] </a>.  What is however clear, is 
  that while the RIAA’s attempt to ban <i>Rio</i> mp3 walkmans resembled an attempt 
  to address the ‘problem’ of piracy, it did this in partial acknowledgement of 
  a deeper failure to control piracy elsewhere<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""> 
  [48] </a>.  </p>
<p>  The <i>Institutional Federation of Phonographic Industries</i> (IFPI) claim 
  that online piracy is ‘manageable’ (Brindley, 2000:39).  Yet, if online piracy 
  is ‘manageable’ surely the music industry has nothing to fear?  If we consider 
  this claim, we find several issues enmeshed within it.  Very little piracy occurs 
  on the World Wide Web itself<a
href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""> [49] </a>.  As the web develops, so 
  do newer generations of improved search applications<a href="#_ftn50"
name="_ftnref50" title=""> [50] </a>.  The American Society of Composers, Authors 
  and Publishers (ASCAP) have their own tool (in the form of a ‘bot’ called <i>‘E-Z 
  Seeker’</i>) which when set to work, will scan through servers on an area of 
  the web in search of ‘illegal’ mp3 files.  By their nature, then, the so-called 
  ‘underground’ web-sites, are <i>created to be found </i>by ‘users’ (as <i>casual 
  </i>pirates), although by this token they are thus traceable by ‘rights owners’ 
  through precisely the same means.  On the surface, ‘bots’ can help keep the 
  number of mp3s ‘online’ to proportions of a reasonably ‘manageable’ scale, although 
  their real fears are not bound up with the web; as I hope to demonstrate shortly 
  with my next case study, we are shifting from the realm of technologies of <i>freedom</i> 
  to free technologies with utmost <i>discretion </i>encoded.  The RIAA’s failure 
  to gain control of the <i>Rio</i> walkman has, if anything, taught the music 
  industry a valuable lesson: that a void needs to be filled – ultimately constructing 
  a division between the mechanics of <i>commerce </i>and the tools for hackers 
  (or enthusiasts).  In this arena there are many noteworthy developments to discuss, 
  we can consider the emergent SDMI-compliant formats such as Microsoft’s Audio 
  codec and MPEG7.  All new waves of PDA notebooks come with mp3 decoding almost 
  as standard; a decompression routine can be added to a device cheaply and with 
  relative simplicity.  When all major WAP-phones and PDAs are likely to be fitted 
  with decompression, where in light of the <i>Rio</i> case, these devices will 
  sit comfortably outside existing RIAA guidelines, a plea for a secure format 
  becomes of greater concern still. Dyson suggests that <i>Playboy </i>magazine 
  began to watermark its images so that they could at least have some means of 
  protecting them from re-publication (1997:139), although something considerably 
  more ‘secure’ will be needed in order to police a future music format.</p>

name="_ftnref52" title=""> [52] </a></font></p>
<p>  It seems clear that complex issues stem from the divide between physical 
  and non-physical space.  There is one rule for the space our bodies inhabit 
  <i>physically</i>; standing on our own land we indeed know <i>our</i> rights.  
  In the spaces we reach through broadband connectivity, however, our rights suddenly 
  seem different; the Internet muddies many of the basic democratic principles 
  we expect in the spaces we inhabit ‘in real life’, as it were.  Online, even 
  the question of <i>where things happen </i>seems to me a matter of ‘physical’, 
  social <i>and</i> legal convention.  Indeed, the majority of ‘property rights’ 
  debates in cyberspace are debates in rights concerning intellectual property<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""> 
  [53] </a>.  Legal scholars such as James Boyle<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""> 
  [54] </a> would point out that all property rights are socially created, limited 
  in extent and qualified in relation both to certain types of actors and certain 
  types of conduct.  Even with a house or a car, the solving-idea of property 
  is indeed problematic, but with intellectual property its problems are just 
  easier to see.  Boyle uses an example of the dangers of html piracy: on the 
  side of his home page is a small .gif image with the message ‘click here’ and 
  ‘to duplicate’ set above and below the image<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""> 
  [55] </a>.  Writer Jon Katz poses a similar question in his discussion of the 
  recent <i>Digital Millennium Copyright Act </i>(DMCA), opening with a reminder 
  that online transactions are virtual, hence not traditionally associated with 
  property: ‘If you loan a CD to a friend who burns himself a copy, have you stolen 
  from the music industry? What if your friend would never have purchased that 
  particular CD anyhow?’<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56"
title=""> [56] </a>.  Although different in approach, both writers hold the DMCA 
  in dispute, similarly deriding it as an example of how ideas concerning <i>physical</i> 
  law and culture can be ‘unthinkingly applied’ to a new type of reality.  Where 
  the ‘work of art’ shifts from the age of mechanical reproduction towards an 
  electronic age, the <i>now</i> aura-less ‘physical’ product begins to exist 
  increasingly as a <i>soft</i>-structure of digital information on a carrier 
  medium; precisely where and how its cultural ‘value’ in this form can be measured 
  seems to have everyone baffled; <i>including</i> Dyson, Katz and Boyle.  </p>
<p>  Jean Baudrillard explains this shift as a process of inversion; one where 
  the ‘medium’ becomes a determinate element in the exchange insofar as it begins 
  to <i>dominate</i> over message, content and subject to a point of saturation 
  within the field of the medium: </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>‘where what was a means of communication gains a kind 
  of finality, and possibly a counter-finality, and then the strategists which 
  revolve around the medium, the communications media, become more essential than 
  the strategies which concern the contents’ (Gane, 1993:145).</p>
<p>  After being set into place eighteen months ago, the DMCA primarily wielded 
  the power to shut down the controversial music-sharing <i>Napster</i><a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""> 
  [57] </a> software at colleges across the US.  Although on many campuses, the 
  software’s ability to shift vast quantities of .mp3 data placed heavy strain 
  upon network servers, causing congestion to the point of crashing; the program’s 
  server-disabling factor offering reason enough in its own right.  In many respects, 
  the software’s heavy demands on resources appearing to be the only significant 
  concern to the US colleges.  Indiana University banned <i>Napster</i> for precisely 
  the reason that it was sapping too many of its’ resources: accounting for up 
  to 60 per cent of all traffic between the campus and the Internet by 12 February, 
  when it was banned<a
href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""> [58] </a>.  What followed was a joint 
  collaboration between the technicians both at the University and at <i>Napster</i>, 
  which led to a significant breakthrough in curbing network congestion and an 
  updated software client.  After the improvements had been set in place the ban 
  was subsequently lifted; both parties involved felt an obligation to make their 
  revelations public (<i>open-source</i>) and the code was submitted in application 
  for its registration as an ‘Internet-standard’ specification (<i>Ibid.</i>).  
  Fascinatingly - although perhaps unsurprisingly – some of those students who 
  were banned from using the software, considered it a blight on their constitutional 
  ‘rights’<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span style='layout-grid-mode:line'> 
  [59] </span></a>, a debate which carries historical resonance within the music 
  industry, especially in the US (<i>See </i>Appendix 1)</p>
<p>  As bandwidths increase, file-sharing software with functions similar to those 
  of <i>Napster</i> are likely to become more commonplace; indeed the attention 
  the software has received of late has led to production of an army of clones<a href="#_ftn60"
name="_ftnref60" title=""> [60] </a> on several platforms, especially in the GNU/GPL 
  arena of ‘collective ownership’ (<i>see </i>Walsh, 1999:170), on open-source 
  platforms, such as Linux.  Many of <i>Napster</i>’s concerns are to stem, as 
  I will shortly explain, not primarily from the fact that it is a potentially 
  damaging piece of software; it’s press tells us this much, but because it is 
  a <i>company</i> and, as such, can be made accountable; <i>Napster</i> may have 
  started out as a college programming<i> </i>project undertaken by a 19-year-old 
  US college student, but it’s now a technology corporation ripe for investment 
  in every aspect, aside perhaps from the chain of pending court cases it is accruing.  
</p>
<p>  Although <i>Napster</i> has been the ‘killer app of the year’, gaining notoriety 
  by artists, colleges, the RIAA and the music industry as a whole<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61"
title=""> [61] </a>, recent evidence supports the view that its six months of 
  fame are coming to an end – a point which I will return to in light of the recent 
  <i>Metallica</i> court case.  However, the implications for the software of 
  this nature spread deeply across several debates.  One of many of <i>Napster</i>’s 
  GPL open-source clones is to take the ‘piracy’ controversy a step further: <i>Gnutella</i>, 
  which unlike <i>Napster</i>, doesn’t rely on a centralised directory for connecting 
  users, meaning no business to invest in and no one to sue, except perhaps its 
  users.  It was an application created by Nullsoft, the programmers of <i>WinAMP</i> 
  (which is believed to be the most popular Windows .mp3 decoder around)<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""> 
  [62] </a>.  On March 14<sup>th</sup> this year, <i>Gnutella</i> was released<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""> 
  [63] </a>, privately, and much to the dismay of Nullsoft’s owners: the AOL/Time-Warner 
  conglomerate – also one of a long chain waiting to take <i>Napster</i> to court 
  – who acted quickly to force the removal of the site (barely 24 hours after 
  its official release).  Sadly for the multi-billion dollar corporation the dye 
  had already been cast and those copies downloaded within this time were reposted 
  almost as quickly as the official site was closed.  As an open-source project, 
  its binaries were publicly available at outset, articulating a space for the 
  development of similar software.</p>
<p>  <i>Gnutella</i>’s implications run deeper still, sparking a debate in line 
  with another key fear surrounding Internet-based technologies: the pornography 
  debate.  Previously I considered the debates surrounding a transition from technologies 
  of <i>freedom</i> to free technologies with utmost <i>discretion </i>encoded; 
  that the development of the web heightened debates surrounding fears of privacy 
  and security is a well-trodden territory<a
href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""> [64] </a>.  MPEG Layer-3 files tend 
  not to survive on the web because they can often be traced easily to a specific 
  IP address or server, this argument can to an extent, I think, hold true for 
  debates surrounding highly <i>illegal</i> images on the web, although insensitive 
  single (.jpg or .bmp) images are undoubtedly less easy to identify (and more 
  time-consuming to ban) than <i>any </i>files with a general .mp3 extension on 
  ‘non-approved’ web-sites.  However, our fears of access to <i>utmost online 
  discretion</i>, although in many cases perhaps desirable (as in reporting a 
  crime) are, I think, of equal concern.  Not long after <i>Gnutella</i>’s release, 
  I found an article which urged me to think about this next wave of highly <i>discreet</i> 
  software in a new light; an Internet where physical <i>anonymity</i> exists 
  even if one is still traceable seems liberating and much has been made of this 
  in terms of theories surrounding race, gender, sexuality and disability.  But 
  an Internet application where ‘near-perfect anonymity’ is offered could be an 
  equally chilling prospect<a
href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""> [65] </a>: one striking at the very 
  heart of the Internet’s most troubling issues.  As Sullivan’s report suggests, 
  <i>Gnutella </i>is a unique application in that it can create virtual private 
  networks, which can form and disappear without a trace, rendering it perfect 
  for discrete transactions.  During one recent 15-minute session, a pornography 
  investigator masquerading as ‘RedOne’ said he found 140 instances of child porn.  
  What was even more chilling were his comments: ‘paedophilia is traded in other 
  ways, but it's just a matter of time before people are caught (...) [<i>Gnutella</i>] 
  is a place where it could flourish. It can't be stopped’ (<i>Ibid.</i>).  Dozens 
  of developers are continuing the <i>Gnutella</i> project in a Linux-like collaborative 
  effort; clearly this new wave of GPL applications – for their virtues <i>and 
  </i>their vices – are here to stay<a
href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""> [66] </a>.</p>
<p>  Perfect anonymity is a key strength of <i>Gnutella</i> over <i>Napster</i> 
  because no government agency can watch what you search for and no marketing 
  department can log your hits and target ads at you.  Study of a report on <i>Metallica</i>’s 
  recent court case on May 10<sup>th</sup>, indicates <i>Napster</i>’s obligation, 
  when notified, to eject users trading copyrighted material off the system; Upon 
  request, <i>Metallica</i> provided <i>Napster</i> with a list of 317,377 usernames 
  monitored over two days, including file details for each user, among other <i>non-personal</i> 
  details such as the time, date and the IP address of the <i>Napster</i> server 
  to which the offending user was connected<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""> 
  [67] </a>. The report did not however, indicate whether the company were to 
  face any fines for providing the software.  Perhaps this is because <i>Napster’</i>s 
  lawyers are employing the ‘<i>Xerox </i>defence’ logic<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""> 
  [68] </a>; in much the same way as <i>Xerox</i> is itself not liable for illegal 
  photocopying made with their machines, <i>Napster</i>’s lawyers will argue that 
  it is individual law-breakers and <i>not</i> the programmers themselves that 
  should be held responsible for piracy.  As more cases are heard, <i>Napster</i>’s 
  future will become clear; RIAA’s current suit seeks $10,000 in damages for <i>each 
  </i>copyright-protected song exchanged (<i>Ibid.</i>), and in the light of <i>Metallica</i>’s 
  progress, other artists will undoubtedly follow suit.</p>
<p>  When <i>Napster</i> is notified of specific users who are trading copyrighted 
  material, it is able to remove them from the system; <i>Gnutella</i> doesn’t 
  allow for this since there is no ‘system’ for users to be removed from.  As 
  long as there are two users with <i>Gnutella</i> software, there will be a <i>Gnutella</i> 
  network.  To stop it, the likelihood is that record companies will have to begin 
  targeting individual users for prosecution.  According to Ian Hall-Beyer’s <i>Gnutella 
  </i>website<a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title=""> [69] </a>, the program, 
  much like the Internet itself, is designed to withstand a nuclear war, or more 
  specifically, a frontal attack from record company lawyers.  <i>Gnutella</i>’s 
  principle of peer-to-peer networking appears to be offering an entirely new 
  architecture for efficient searching.  Unlike search-engines that create indexes 
  which quickly go out of date, <i>Gnutella -</i> like <i>Napster -</i> searches 
  machines connected to the net at that time, saving time for the user by alleviating 
  almost any prospect of <i>dead</i> links.  Artists, the music industry and the 
  RIAA, it seems, will not be resting too soon; we are, I believe, still on the 
  eve of a significant change.</p>
<p><b>Towards a Conclusion</b></p>
<p>  In <i>Out of Control</i>, Kelly addresses issues concerning privacy, stating 
  that encryption and digital signatures ‘are techniques to expand the dynamics 
  of trust into a new territory (…) Pretty good privacy means pretty good society’ 
  (:273).  In light of open-source developments we can certainly see a negative 
  side to such technology; when a branch of privacy becomes ‘pretty good’ that 
  transactions can be made in utmost discretion, there is a clear and present 
  right to be alarmed.  On the flipside, the industry can equally make legitimate 
  use of such tightening of security and privacy.  For example, let us imagine 
  a version of <i>Napster</i> in which the user logs onto a secure server, with 
  their credit-card details (or an e-money account) and was charged a feasible 
  amount (say 50 pence) for every song they downloaded. If they wanted the newest 
  music, they could be guaranteed a high-quality <i>complete</i> file with no 
  ‘glitches’.  This download would be fully watermarked using SDMI standards and 
  royalties, where due, would be credited instantly to the artists as soon as 
  the transaction was made.  What’s more, the watermarked music could be encoded 
  in such a way that it could be exchanged quite simply with the users’ own PDA, 
  mobile phone or PC; this would be legal, in much the same way as it is <i>apparently</i> 
  ‘legal’ to make a personal copy of a CD onto Tape, MP3 or MiniDisc.  A user 
  is listening to a radio stream whilst driving and suddenly decides that they 
  want to listen to a song, the radio station holds a huge archive of digital 
  music on servers and will stream any track to a listener for a small fee (say 
  10 pence).  Radio technology is already in place in cars and the scenario I 
  have described exists in the form of video-on-demand.  New formats (such as 
  the secure MP7) incorporate more advanced search techniques than before, such 
  as the ability to search by lyrics or through humming a melody.  A combination 
  of all such existing technologies will undoubtedly articulate a space for new 
  modes of music delivery and commerce.  The logical next stage is surely for 
  the industry to develop a secure rival format to fill a void in the digital 
  format market.  Increased failure to do this will gain the .mp3 format more 
  notoriety, making it more of a <i>de facto</i> standard than it already is.</p>
<p>  Of course, within an industry undergoing such a significant set of changes, 
  it is difficult to draw any solid conclusions.  However, as has perhaps <i>always</i> 
  been the case within this industry, the market will be technologically divided 
  between ‘professional’ and ‘non-professional’.  On the one hand there will be 
  the <i>hobbyist</i> side who will, I suspect, continue to use MPEG layer-3 technology 
  and the ‘search and capture’ routines that are already in place online.  On 
  the other, commercial interests will be protected and supported by the interests 
  of other existing media, such as film, radio and television.  For this side, 
  an equivalent SDMI-conforming technology, such as <i>Microsoft’s </i>Windows 
  Media Technologies-4 compression technique or MP7 will eventually become ‘industry 
  standard’.  In many respects this divide mirrors quite exactly the continuing 
  battle between the renegade open-source hacker ‘<i>Linux</i>’ culture, which 
  believes that all information should be free, set against the corporate windows 
  of influence exerted by Microsoft.  That the industry will continue to manage 
  artists, composers and performers is I believe, inevitable; although existing 
  structures of address and control will begin to transmogrify to incorporate 
  the new arm of technological development.  The AOL conglomerate may take a while 
  yet to find its feet, but much seems to be already in place.  A shift is imminent, 
  although I suspect in a short space of time, many will find it familiar enough.

    to the principle for digital compression adopted by Sony for its MiniDisc 
    system.  Psychoacoustic masking takes the parts of the sound that are most 
    perceptible at any given moment and represents them with the most detail.  
    The least perceptible parts are therefore represented with the least accuracy.  
    Although the process of compression loses much of the original signal, the 
    effects on the ear seem minimal.  Therefore the compressed sample ‘sounds’ 
    like its original.</p>

  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref11"

    perhaps this marks the same division between story and ‘text’ (<i>as</i> literature).  
    Elsewhere in his book, Frith tells us that in 1911 the ‘Copyright Act’ entered 
    UK law (1996:23).  From a historical perspective, this chimes in neatly with 
    Walter Benjamin’s (1955/1992:214) exploration of the shift witnessed in around 
    1900, where technical reproduction ‘had reached a standard that not only permitted 
    it to reproduce all transmitted works of art and thus to cause the most profound 
    change in their impact upon the public’, toward a ‘new’ change in <i>understandings 
    of </i>the meaning of ‘art in its traditional form’ (<i>Ibid.</i>).</p>

    (1995:329 fn.27).  Drawing upon the work of Marx, Baudrillard (1976/1988:125) 
    considers a structural ‘revolution’ of value where the sign is <i>emancipated 
    </i>from any equation of ‘real’ contents that give the sign weight; this results 
    in a mode of <i>simulation</i> where signs exchange freely amongst themselves.  
    Notions of <i>value</i> weighting signs are now written out of their originary 
    history.  Aragon and Sampaio (1998:153) illustrate the origin of this type 
    of loss within the shift from analog to digital sound recording.  Where <i>information 
    </i>(in speech or writing) was once clothed in a cultural context which provided 
    clear (practical) signifiers to forms of identity, conversion (reduction) 
    of those codes to binary form, with a tendency towards straightforward (fast) 
    <i>cloning</i> of bits, initial connotative meanings (by virtue of cultural 
    histories weighted upon them) are stripped of history in a transition towards 
    the digital, allowing for a reconfiguration of cultural context and signifiers.</p>

name="_ftn39" title=""> [39] </a> Much hardware is now produced with the ‘home’ 
    user in mind.  Ever since the development of the Atari 520 ST (approximately 
    14 years ago), and its ability to control sound hardware via a series of MIDI 
    (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) ports, musicians have found computers 
    to offer a cheap and effective means for centralised control and synchronisation 
    of several sound devices (<i>e.g. </i>keyboard, drum machine, sampler etc).  
    As machines have improved, many of these devices have been emulated via computer 
    software, so the computer has <i>become </i>that which it once controlled.  
    With the advent of faster data transfer and higher-speed, higher-capacity 
    storage, computers have become increasingly more adept at functioning as <i>Virtual 
    </i>recording studios: high capacity ‘multi-track’ sequencers and samplers 
    - controlling both external MIDI devices whilst emulating others internally.</p>

<div id=ftn40> 
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref40"
name="_ftn40" title=""> [40] </a> The growth of the computer software industry 
    has, however, led to the development of copy protection for <i>some</i> data 
    CDs; the most common standard in the UK is called ‘safedisc’, although several 
    other systems are known to be in circulation in the US.  Although ‘safedisc’ 
    undoubtedly makes piracy <i>less easy</i>, many Internet sites seem to demonstrate 
    that software protection on the CD surface can be bypassed with the correct 
    software.  In fact, an illegal ‘patch’ has been developed (and revised) by 
    several pirates, which has been made available via some piracy servers on 
    the Internet <i>see: </i>&lt;<a

  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref41"

    Essentially, ripping ‘facilitates piracy’, as any code (as a string of binary 
    digits) on a CD can be ‘ripped’ (read) straight from the CD as a <i>near-flawless</i> 
    replica (<i>and</i> Brindley draws a distinction between an <i>analogue tape</i> 
    ‘copy’ and a <i>digital </i>‘clone’) of the original code.  This process (of 
    ripping) can be repeated indefinitely, as there are no limits as to what can 
    be read from the disc surface.  From here, the ‘ripped’ Digital Audio Data 
    (DAC) can be converted simply into a computer wave form (as any .wav sample), 
    through the simple creation of a small ‘header’ data-file on the DAC data, 
    or the code can be run through an .mp3 compression codec (of which there are 
    several –commercial and ‘freeware’ codecs available) for conversion into an 
    MPEG layer-3 sample. </p>

  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><a href="#_ftnref46"
name="_ftn46" title=""> [46] </a> AHRA becomes problematic where computers are 
    concerned, because their ability to transfer (or clone) digital information 
    is not “designed or marketed for the primary purpose of  (…) making a digital 
    audio copied recording” (<i>Source: </i>AHRA Title 17, sec. 1001 <i>Cit.</i> 
    CSTB, 2000:Ch.2).  In many respects, computers – by their very nature - can 
    do anything with digital information, including precisely that which is outlawed 
    by the AHRA.  Short of insisting upon hardware that restricts the functioning 
    of the computer, little can be done to prevent this.  Therefore, the <i>Rio</i> 
    case exposed a significant loophole in the law, one which could effectively 
    bypass the policy with the incorporation of a ‘computer’ front-end into the 
    device.  One such example – among many other PDA personal organisers - is 
    Empeg’s &lt;<a href="http://www.empeg.com/">www.empeg.com</a>&gt;Linux-based 
    device, <i>See: </i>&lt;<a

    (<i>Cit.</i> CSTB:Ch.2).  IT companies, it would appear, already fully understand 
    this loophole and have admitted that mp3 functionality can be incorporated 
    almost <i>freely</i> into electronic organisers, that<span lang=EN-US> a ‘standalone

    numerous other Internet applications, which act more efficiently as back-doors 
    for accessing mp3s.  One such example lies in accessing search engines on
