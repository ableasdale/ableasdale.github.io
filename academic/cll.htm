<p><b>Week 2: Hysteria – Fantasy, Memory and the ‘Real Event’</b></p>
<p>We begin by looking at techniques to trace and examine the <i>real event</i>: 
  steps taken to find the memory catalysing first occurrences of hysterical behaviour.  
  Breuer and Freud (1893) were interested in abreaction: a process still used 
  in some forms of psychotherapy.  If the analysand is unable to make a causal 
  link between a precipitating event and their adoption of a pathological phenomenon, 
  s/he can then be hypnotised and, through the analysts’ deployment of a variety 
  of hypnotic techniques, the analysand can take them to the location of a traumatic 
  event (while perhaps locating repressed unconscious memories) and ask them to 
  recall it in detail.  Abreaction serves two functions: firstly, a scene of emotional 
  disturbance is located and replayed (transferred) from unconscious into consciousness 
  through re-enactment of the scene.  In the process of ‘acting out’, unbound 
  ‘neurotic’ energy is bound to the scene and ‘catharsis’ can be achieved when, 
  after a number of abreaction processes, the analysand finally locates the source 
  of the hysteria: the event where the problem was first raised.  Unbound energy 
  can only be bound if the traumatic experience occurs simultaneously (and intensely), 
  in sync with the replay of the event.  In order for complete catharsis to occur, 
  the <i>real event </i>must be found and played in full.  I see this process 
  as a form of internal exorcism: abreaction is the where the conflict between 
  the two entities takes place, success depends on whether the process itself 
  is more potent than the energy and can seize it and bind it.  Frosh (1987) cites 
  Freud's own belief that psychoanalysis could not bring about a major transformation 
  of the quality of human experience.  It could, however be able to turn 'hysterical 
  misery' into 'common unhappiness' (211).  Binding is perhaps best described 
  as the process that makes this transformation possible: by fusing the ‘free’ 
  hysterical energy with a memory through abreaction, what is left is the unhappiness 
  of the memory.</p>
<p>Such a form of psychoanalysis is not without problems.  Under hypnosis, the 
  analysand is delicately under the supervision of the analyst.  As with any form 
  of physical treatment, the analyst – like a doctor - needs to make accurate 
  informed assessments.  Successful analysis relies upon a balance between the 
  assessment of the analyst and the departing of truthful, accurate information 
  from the analysand.  It is a case of both mutual respect and trust.  An analysis 
  using techniques such as the <i>pressure technique</i> could force unhealthy 
  conclusions to be drawn from the session.  When dealing with internal mental 
  problems, forging a competent analysis is indicative of the time spent between 
  analyst and analysand, surely the only means for building a mutual trust and 
  understanding.  This leads to another problem, perhaps best illustrated in the 
  case of Bertha Pappenheim<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a>: the patient referred 
  to as ‘Anna O’ - Breuer’s technique of catharsis fuelled the development of 
  a ‘transference love’ for him by his patient, resulting in her manufacture of 
  a phantom pregnancy (pseudocyesis), of whom Breuer was the father<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> 
  [2] </span></a>.  The transference was also mutual; Jones (<i>cit. </i>Balmary, 
  1979:87) observes a process of counter-transference: ‘his [Breuer’s] wife became 
  bored at listening to no other topic (…) unhappy and morose’.  Breuer had either 
  failed to acknowledge, or blocked, the fact that his wife was becoming jealous 
  and that his patient had been ‘invisibly’ developing a fantasy-pregnancy in 
  response to their treatment.  When he saw her, he was shocked: she [according 
  to Breuer] ‘had never made any allusions to such a forbidden topic’.  He found 
  he could calm her -through hypnotism – and once he had done so, he left the 
  house, terminating any subsequent treatment.  Freud would later incorporate 
  transference into his own method, treating it as another symptom in the chain 
  and moving on<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> [3] </span></a>. 
  <span style='font-size:8.0pt;'></span></p>
<p><b>Week 2: Additional Ideas and Notes</b></p>
<p>If we consider <i>trauma</i> to be a web of reminiscences, which are internally 
  irreconcilable, then it makes sense to look at the mind as a topographical network 
  with lines and nodes.  If an affect is trapped in the wrong place on the network, 
  or a rogue piece of data is in the wrong place, problems occur: parts of the 
  network may experience heavy strain, some parts may not work properly.  A machine 
  occupies an address on a network, which is bound to a pointer on a registry 
  (likewise with files on a disk).  If the pointers are not set correctly, the 
  system will be unable to find the machine or file, causing errors.  To fix the 
  problem it is necessary to delve into the system and locate (repair) the missing 
  link, in order for the network/machine to become aware of what was previously 
  non-existent (because not referenced properly).  Interestingly, it seems that 
  whenever cognitive science attempts to explain how the mind works, it uses a 
  similar set of processes: mechanical terminology and flow-charts depicting processes 
  between devices.  Systems ‘analysts’ are people who are believed to be experts 
  at troubleshooting system problems.</p>
<p>I saw <i>Felicia’s Journey</i> (1999 <i>Dir:</i> Atom Egoyan) this week.  The 
  film’s narrative relies upon a series of flashbacks to childhood memories, experienced 
  by the main character (played by Bob Hoskins) and these related to traumatic 
  events and moments of discomfort.  We see the discomfort caused by the conscious 
  recollection of these memories through his obsessive clasping of hands, fidgeting 
  and the pain cast upon his face as the memories play.  These moments also offer 
  us, as spectators, a chance to adopt the role of the analyst: to draw conclusions 
  from the historical data offered to us by such insights, to allow links between 
  the character as a grown man and the situations triggering specific blocks of 
  childhood memories.  I began to feel I could <i>even</i> justify some of his 
  actions - despite knowing they were wrong - by virtue of the moments replayed 
  when prompted by situations in the film.  After the film, I found myself desperately 
  trying to diagnose the cause of his problems and explain the motives behind 
  his behaviour through the insight gained from his childhood memories.<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  </span> </p>
<p><b>Week 3: Fantasy, Childhood and Creativity</b></p>
<p>Freud’s essay (1908) sets the agenda for the developmental psychology of children.  
  His theories are the result of observation, adult ‘neurotic’ memories of childhood 
  experiences and his own interpretation of unconscious memories <i>revised</i> 
  into conscious material through psychoanalysis.  Freud’s first distinction is 
  that most adults discredit children’s levels of sexual ‘activity’.  Adults do 
  not observe any such capacity in children, and any manifestations of this would 
  be quickly suppressed.  From a quantity of data gained from adult neurotic patients, 
  Freud is able to raise a fundamental issue regarding developmental psychology; 
  it is through his examination of the environmental factors concerning the upbringing 
  of a ‘healthy’ child that he offers a blueprint for a child’s reception of information.  
  By regulating the flow of sexual knowledge passed to a developing child, or 
  worse, lying outright to them, there is a risk of hindering childhood development 
  by corrupting its internal logic<a
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span> [4] </span></a>.  Lies - kernels 
  of neuroses - can split off and construct their own fantasy structures within 
  the child’s internal world.  Freud constructs criteria for distinguishing between 
  the ‘normal’ and the neurotic: their roots frequently lie in childhood upbringing.  
  The case of Little Hans (1909)<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><span> [5] </span></a> offers insight into the construction 
  of fantasy structures in child development.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This case was unique: perhaps the first case study to look directly at a child’s 
  progress.  Freud is the professor to the father, who plays Hans’s analyst.  
  As Hans develops, his father, who refers to Freud for final analysis, monitors 
  his progress.  Hans’s enthusiastic adoption of the Oedipus complex – and his 
  subsequent cure<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"
title=""><span> [6] </span></a> - make him a perfect case for the promotion of 
  Freudian psychoanalysis and Freud often speaks fondly of him: ‘Hans confirms 
  in the most concrete and uncompromising manner (…) [he] really was a little 
  Oedipus’ (269).  What is fascinating about the case, by virtue of Hans being 
  analysed by his own father<a href="#_ftn7"
name="_ftnref7" title=""><span> [7] </span></a>, is that Hans gradually begins 
  to interact with the process of analysis and incorporates the rules of psychoanalysis 
  into his own conscious development.  Freud offers congratulatory footnotes on 
  Hans’s astute observations of the psychoanalytic processes he has become surrounded 
  by (<i>See </i>pp.233, 251), and Hans is happy to be analysed; even entertaining 
  the possibility that Freud must speak to God in order to be able to read so 
  much into his thoughts (205).  Freud offers words of caution in the first page 
  of his discussion on the ‘uncompromising objection’ of the father as analyst 
  ‘who went to work, instilled with <i>my </i>theoretical views and infected with 
  <i>my </i>prejudices, must be entirely devoid of any objective worth’ (260).  
  A child is <i>highly</i> suggestible, and <i>suggestion</i>, as Freud notes, 
  was an ‘awkward’ term within the dialectic of psychoanalysis (261).   Hans becomes 
  aware of the <i>process of interrogation</i> surrounding his own <i>interrogation</i> 
  of his relation to his fantasies, the development of his own psychical reality 
  and the desired relation to his parents from a young age, ultimately sharing 
  the realisation that ‘all knowledge is patchwork … each step forward leaves 
  an unsolved residue behind’ (259).  Hans’s unconscious complexes are systematically 
  identified and presented to Hans’s conscious via his father’s (and Freud’s) 
  techniques of suggestion and interpretation, which are duly processed <i>in 
  their own words</i> (278) and duly relayed to Hans.   Their achievement – other 
  than to ‘cure’ Hans of his <i>irrational</i> phobias - was in the sum of its 
  parts to demonstrate the values of analysis.  Freud’s last ‘word’ on the subject 
  concisely stating that: ‘<i>analysis replaces repression by condemnation</i>’<i> 
  </i>(301).</p>

'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span> 
<p>Felman (1987:113-4) re-reads Lacan’s discussion of a psychoanalytic exercise 
  attempted by Melanie Klein, who adopts the Oedipus complex as a structure of 
  address in the treatment of a four-year old boy - Dick – himself intellectually 
  level with an eighteen-month old child<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span> 
  [8] </span></a> and ‘largely devoid of affects’ (Mitchell, 1991:98), causing 
  inability to adapt to ‘reality’ and lack of emotional relation to his environment.  
  Unlike Little Hans, clearly loved by his parents<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span> 
  [9] </span></a>, Dick ‘grew up in an environment unusually poor in love’ (<i>Ibid.</i> 
  100).  Failure of initiation of such key steps in childhood development resulted 
  in a child [seemingly] without any trace of an unconscious, who ‘emits no call’ 
  (<i>see </i>Felman, 1987:122).  Klein’s first therapeutic undertaking, then, 
  is to unlock the unconscious and enable therapy to occur.  Her originating moment 
  of therapeutic intervention lies in a clinical usage of Oedipus by adopting, 
  to quote Lacan, a principle of ‘symbolic extrapolation’ (<i>Cit. Ibid.</i> 107).  
  Klein uses two toy trains: a little train (<i>Dick</i>) and a big train (<i>Daddy</i>).  
  Eventually Dick mentions the word ‘<i>station</i>’.  Klein aligns the station 
  with ‘<i>Mummy</i>’ and issues the symbolic idea that ‘<i>Dick is going into 
  Mummy</i>’.  The dialogue between Klein and the child progresses on these lines<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span> 
  [10] </span></a>.</p>
<p>Lacan prompts the question: ‘What then has Melanie Klein in effect done? Nothing 
  other than to provide verbalisation.  She has symbolised an effective relation, 
  the relation of being, named, with another’ (<i>Cit. Ibid.</i>113).  Dick has 
  responded to Klein’s ‘mechanically imposed’ symbolisation of the Oedipus myth.  
  He ‘symbolises the reality surrounding him out of this kernel, of this palpitating 
  cell of symbolism which Klein has provided him with.  This is what she calls, 
  later on, “having opened the doors of the unconscious”’(C<i>it. Ibid.</i>114).  
  The first intervention and perhaps the only method of awakening communication 
  with a child who emits no call, is to create an initial structure of address. 
  This is what Klein’s symbolic creation has offered, and therefore how the doors 
  of the unconscious have been unlocked.  In order to understand the process further, 
  we can consider the role played by the ‘Other’<a href="#_ftn11"
name="_ftnref11" title=""><span> [11] </span></a>, a third term existing in a 
  triangular dialogic relationship between analyst and analysand: the locus of 
  unconscious language.  In Dick’s terms, his unconscious activity is the discourse 
  of the ‘Other’ because it is constructed by Klein’s discourse, so Dick’s unconscious 
  is bound to Klein’s performance in interpretation and Klein is not using her 
  own interpretation, by virtue of the discourse of the ‘Other’ she is using to 
  mediate: her interpretation of the discourse of the Oedipal myth.</p>

<p><b>Week 4: The ‘Fantastic’ - Psychoanalysis and The Question of Reading &amp;</b></p>
<p><b>Week 5: The ‘Uncanny’ – Freud’s Literary Criticism</b></p>
<p class=MsoFooter>Interpreting is an altogether different thing than having the 
  fancy of understanding.  One is the opposite of the other.  I will even say 
  that it is on the basis of a certain refusal of understanding that we can open 
  the door onto psychoanalytic understanding (Lacan, <i>cit.</i> Felman, 1987:108).</p>
<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>The question here again is not what does the 
  story <i>mean</i> but what does the story <i>do? </i>(Felman: <i>Ibid.</i>109)</span></p>
<p class=MsoFooter>Here Lacan and Felman are investigating the philosophy of linguistic 
  interpretation.  Through psychoanalytic discourse, Felman (1982) demonstrates 
  how the critical discourses surrounding James’s text become bound with the transference 
  ‘trap’ structured into the story, making her text a case study in literary transference.  
  Moreover, both psychoanalysis and literature seem inextricably bound, as both 
  set this process of transference into play, constructing an enclosed loop between 
  the text as analyst (psyche as text)<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span> 
  [12] </span></a>, and the analysands both within the story (as characters) and 
  its’ critics and readers outside.  Felman takes her role as analyst in an investigation 
  that embodies James, Freud and Lacan to bolster her own reading strategy.  Felman 
  highlights the master/slave hierarchical structure between psychoanalysis and 
  literature and attempts to balance the two using James’s text as a possible 
  example of how this can be achieved, yet by doing so she asserts a new master/slave 
  structure and with her mastery of the ‘reading effect’ she is demonstrating 
  to unpack, it seems she is perhaps equally guilty of the same process<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span> 
  [13] </span></a>.</p>
<p>Here my plan is to bridge between weeks four and five by comparing Todorov’s 
  (1973) approach to uncanny literature with Freud’s (1919) essay.  At outset, 
  Freud ‘pleads guilty’ to an ‘obtuseness’ towards experiencing the <i>uncanny</i>; 
  maintaining that it has been long since he had done so, telling his audience 
  that he must first ‘awake’ from within himself the possibility of experiencing 
  this quality (340) and yet, in a footnote later in the essay he remarks upon 
  the uncanny nature of his own reflection on a train journey (371), when a ‘more 
  than usually violent jolt’ swings open a door to expose a looking glass and 
  Freud confuses the <i>frightening </i>reflection with someone else walking into 
  his compartment<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span> [14] </span></a> 
  (<i>and curiously</i>: Balmary, (1982:101), speculates on Freud’s own ‘phobia’ 
  of railways).  Todorov, as Donald (1989) points out, applies the uncanny to 
  strange events for which there is a rational explanation not immediately apparent 
  to the deceiving mind of the spectator (238).  Todorov attempts to examine how 
  a genre functions and how we as readers work in relation to genre<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span> 
  [15] </span></a>.  Freud talks about a <i>surmounting</i> knowledge of a genre 
  (1919:370), and explains that we won’t be abreacted emotionally by a ghost story 
  unless we <i>surmount</i> its’ contents (through reality-testing) and decide 
  that it <i>still</i> is.  However, our surmounting knowledge (awareness) of 
  its <i>form</i> (as Todorov examines it), will perhaps repress an actual sense 
  of the uncanny.  Such uncanny experiences, then, are related to our positioning 
  in a cultural context and <i>as</i> individuals, prompting me to ask: if the 
  uncanny <i>is</i> related to the ‘old class of frightening’: <i>are early horror 
  films still scary?<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span> [16] </span></a></i> 
  So in <i>The Sandman</i>, Freud explains that anyone disregarding ‘animistic 
  beliefs’<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"
title=""><span> [17] </span></a> will be insensible to Olympia’s existence.  As 
  Todorov observes, the uncanny is ‘the supernatural explained’ (1973:41 <i>see 
  also</i> Jackson, 1981:21), so the uncanny can only be activated by phenomena 
  of a ‘natural’ origin; Freud ‘cannot think of any genuine fairy story which 
  has anything uncanny about it’ (1919:369).  Fascinatingly, the more he tries 
  to prise reality and fantasy apart, the more he seems to need to resort to fiction 
  to stave off the uncanny; this is where the myriad of criticism begins, as Wright 
  observes: ‘what is interesting is precisely the inadequacy of his interpretation, 
  and how this inadequacy has produced a series of after-effects’ (1998:128).</p>
<p>Todorov represents the aesthetic investigation that Freud denies himself in 
  his conclusion<a href="#_ftn18"
name="_ftnref18" title=""><span> [18] </span></a>.  Freud does not move through 
  ‘subjective’ situations in psychoanalysis because he’s not regarding the same 
  narrative structures as Todorov.  When Freud’s systematic working through of 
  the term<i> heimlich<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span> [19] 
  </span></a></i> is compared with Todorov’s treatment of the <i>form </i>of the 
  fantastic, by virtue of both authors use of structural analysis, there are structural 
  similarities, but Todorov plots the space of his argument as he makes it by 
  moving between the structuring posits, whereas Freud’s is subject to his own 
  other discussions through psychoanalytic discourse (<i>narcissism</i>, <i>father 
  imago</i>, <i>castration</i>, <i>etc.</i>).  So Todorov’s essay appears as a 
  more encapsulating text<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span> [20] 
  </span></a>.  Freud pushes us into an aesthetic reading of the text, whereas 
  Todorov’s reading functions as a work on aesthetics through a framework of structuralism.  
  At its fundamental level, fantasy <i>is</i> fiction and Todorov’s notion of 
  the <i>naïve</i> reader<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span> [21] 
  </span></a> seems to state that they will take fantasy as fact.  Despite the 
  fact that there is an informed intertextuality within his texts, he denies the 
  ‘intertextual’ capacity at reader level.  Todorov investigates his texts from 
  within his own structural framework, so when he examines <i>The Saragossa Manuscript</i>, 
  he reads the discourses of ‘fantasy’ against ‘reality’ as presumed against the 
  identification of the individual (naïve) reader.  His <i>readings</i>, then, 
  divert from his own structural rubric by assuming <i>only one</i> part them 
  (that of the naïve reader’s identification with the main character).  Therefore, 
  his premise seems to disregard the fact that texts <i>may</i> have their own 
  general identity.  He structures a bizarre identity for the ‘fantastic’ literature, 
  and his <i>marvelous</i> does seem to slide into the <i>uncanny</i>, especially 
  when the <i>uncanny</i> is surmounted as a ‘known’ genre (so according to his 
  criteria: the condition of modernist science fiction is <i>marvelous</i>, yet 
  he fails to mention the ways in which such literature has provided certain generic 
  conditions for <i>its own</i> framing of the <i>marvelous</i> within science 
  fiction texts<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span> [22] </span></a>).  
  Todorov’s text allows for no consideration of ‘author’; he produces a de-authored 
  model typical to structuralism.  And do ‘fantasy’ and ‘genre’ really go together? 
  (<i><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>See Footnote #20</span></i>)</p>
<p>Todorov critiques Freud (1973:48) on his treatment of principles of transgression: 
  ‘the uncanny originates, then, in certain themes linked to more or less ancient 
  taboos.  If we grant that primal experience is constituted by transgression, 
  we can accept Freud’s theory as to the origin of the uncanny’.  Primal experience 
  of the uncanny is related to transgression in ‘acceptable reality’ and is located 
  at the point where the two factors cross.  He argues that for the majority of 
  the ‘reading public’, detective stories have replaced ghost stories (49).  The 
  murder mystery incorporates a <i>fantastic </i>murder, which like his model 
  of the <i>fantastic narrative</i>, offers two solutions: one probable and one 
  rational.  However, the detective story (and we must remember that Todorov is 
  dealing strictly with <i>classes</i>, or <i>genres</i>), <i>transgresses</i> 
  the genre (or, more correctly, the <i>mode</i>) of the fantastic, by virtue 
  of its closure, which implies <i>generically</i> a ‘rational solution’ within 
  the text.  However, this transgression <i>should</i> offer the reader an uncanny 
  experience prior to its final explanation.  Todorov does not talk about reality 
  in such a blasé way as Freud; and he uses Freud as an example of someone who 
  integrates the transgressive impulse into his literary approach to the uncanny.</p>
<p>Much criticism has been levelled at Freud’s [lack of] treatment of the uncanny 
  nature of Olympia, the automation, in his criticism of <i>the Sandman</i>.  
  Cixous (1976) criticises Freud of over-stabilising the text through his sole 
  concentration on eyes (<i>cit.</i> Jackson 1981:67).  Wright (1998:133), citing 
  Rubin (1982), explains that Olympia, the ‘double’ is dealt with only in three 
  footnotes and is then simply reduced by Freud to ‘Nathaniels feminine attitude 
  to his father in infancy’ (1919:354).  Hertz (1979:303) talks of Freud’s ‘second 
  account of the story, offered in a long and stunningly condensed footnote’, 
  and criticises him for such a short-sighted diagnosis.  Donald (1989:238), also 
  citing Cixous’s essay, observes the partiality of his reading, which reveals 
  his own anxieties and repetition compulsions, argues Olympia should not be seen 
  as ‘counterpart or reflection’ (and Hertz explains this), but should be considered 
  as ‘neither dead or alive’.  So Freud <i>almost</i> ignores Olympia, although 
  he does lay the doll for the reader to see, only as a shallow grave in his text.  
  Balmary (1979:28-32) offers a fascinating study of Freud’s relation to statues, 
  which I hope may perhaps offer an explanation for Freud’s treatment of Olympia 
  as somehow alive.  Citing a passage from Ernest Jones’s <i>The Life and Work 
  of Sigmund Freud</i> (1953-7), who talks about Freud’s holiday pursuits, Balmary 
  attempts to analyse Freud’s peculiar relation to mushrooms and statues.  It 
  seems as if he treated both objects as if they were real<a href="#_ftn23"
name="_ftnref23" title=""><span> [23] </span></a>.  Freud, it is said, ‘could 
  be boyish enough on occasions’ and had a habit of ‘bringing his latest purchase 
  of an antiquity, usually a small statuette, to the dinner table and placing 
  it in front of him as a companion during the meal’ (<i>Cit.</i> Balmary, 1979:29).  
  This statue would be returned to his desk after the meal, only to be brought 
  back ‘a day or two’ later.  Balmary then links this ‘dinner invite’ to the conclusion 
  a famous story of a statue that walks: <i>Don Giovanni</i>, one of Freud’s favourite 
  stories, of which she provides a brief summary (30-1).  On Freud’s ‘mushroom 
  hunting’ expeditions, Balmary (39) explains that Freud was rather interested 
  in one particular mushroom: the <i>Steinpilz</i>.  In German, ‘stein’ means 
  ‘stone’, so it is the ‘stone mushroom’ Freud seeks.</p>

<b>Weeks 7 - 8: Reading The Vampire (I &amp; II)</b> 
<p>The origins of vampire folklore stretch back thousands of years and elements 
  of vampire-like behaviour seem to have manifested themselves into almost every 
  culture around the world.  In different cultural forms, there exist mythical 
  beings whose behaviour can be considered in some ways vampire-like.  From the 
  <i>Chiang-shih</i> in China to the Greek <i>Lamia</i> once loved by Zeus<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span> 
  [24] </span></a>, the fox-like <i>Kappa</i> in Japan to the <i>Pananggalang</i> 
  women-spirits in Malaysia, uncountable volumes of stories have been told that 
  in some ways embody vampire characteristics.  However, perhaps the most easily 
  identifiable twentieth-century vampire representations find their roots in the 
  Slavic, or Eastern European mythology.  These stories were once believed to 
  have originated from the Far East (from the supernatural entities of China, 
  Tibet and India), travelling down to the Mediterranean along the silk route, 
  where they moved across the Black Sea coast into Greece, the Balkans and then 
  through the Carpathian mountains into Hungary and Transylvania.  But my own 
  reading finds the mythological strands geographically so diverse that the mythology 
  appears universal, somehow embedded in the human psyche rather than being traceable 
  to a single source. Perhaps the only means to trace the folklore’s origins is 
  via examination of the links between stories at different historical stages 
  of their development, chronologically exploring the different strands of the 
  vampire myth and breaking it down into separate sub-mythologies.  Any study 
  purporting to trace the roots of what now constitutes the sum of vampirism’s 
  forms - perhaps like the mode of <i>the</i> <i>fantastic</i> itself (<i>cf. 
  </i>Jackson, 1981:1,<i> </i>13) – must examine a range of representations so 
  ubiquitous and so protean in form, that generic categorisation becomes difficult.  
  The vampire myth has been constructed and reconstructed so frequently over time 
  and space that it seems bound to the roots of fantasy and we can almost chart 
  the historical development of psychoanalytic theory by examining the range of 
  perspectives it has produced to explain the precipitating cause of the mythology’s 
  development.  I will investigate a selection of these later.</p>
<p>In Slavic cultures in Eastern and central Europe, vampirism was an integral 
  part of their belief system and, as Stoker’s Dracula<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span> 
  [25] </span></a> was largely based on the fifteenth-century Romanian prince 
  Vlad ‘Tepes’ [the Impaler]<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26"
title=""><span> [26] </span></a>, and ‘Castle Dracula’ supposedly located ‘near 
  Borgo Pass’ in Transylvania, north central Romania, it is understandable that 
  the two have closely become bound in the recent common-held myth of vampire 
  origin in the West.  Interestingly, further examinations of Slavic territory 
  reveal that Romania and Hungary, although in the midst of Slavic lands, are 
  in fact non-Slavic (<i>see</i> Melton, 1994:560).  It is perhaps also useful 
  to trace another parallel here: the entry of the word ‘vampire’ into English 
  language (from Serbia) can be traced historically to the case of Arnold Paole, 
  and its’ subsequent 1732 report<a
href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span> [27] </span></a>, which was believed 
  to mark a point of revived interest in vampires; perhaps one of the key factors 
  that shaped Stoker’s early research.  Two less popular reports of ‘vampire-like 
  beings’ in England can be found dating back as far as the 1100s: Walter Map’s 
  <i>De Nagis Curialium</i> (1190) and William of Newburgh’s <i>Chronicles</i> 
  (1196)<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span> [28] </span></a>.  
  Much of the historical information cited in <i>Dracula</i>, by Dracula himself 
  (<i>see </i>p.43), and later through Van Helsing (<i>see </i>p.309)<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span> 
  [29] </span></a>, acknowledges a debt to research undertaken by William Wilkinson 
  in <i>An Account of Wallachia and Moldavia </i>(1820).  Stoker, it is believed, 
  had never visited Transylvania himself, and fashioned many of his insights into 
  setting, staking and repelling ‘the vampire’ on Emily Gerard’s <i>The Land Beyond 
  The Forest </i>(1888)<a
href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span> [30] </span></a>.  </p>
<p>Paul Barber (1996) examines the phenomenon of historical vampire-cases and 
  with specific reference to the Peter Plogojowitz case<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span> 
  [31] </span></a>, offers a scientific analysis of the case in an attempt to 
  account for it in the light of increased scientific understanding, moving the 
  case for the first time away from the customs of folklore and superstition initially 
  applied to it.  He cites a witness report of the ‘un-dead’ Plogowitz before 
  attempting to de-mystify it: -</p>
<p>‘The hair and beard -- even the nails, of which the old ones had fallen away 
  -- had grown on [the corpse]; the old skin, which was somewhat whitish, had 
  peeled away, and a new fresh one had emerged under it (...) Not without astonishment, 
  I saw some fresh blood in his mouth, which, according to the common observation, 
  he had sucked from the people killed by him’<a href="#_ftn32"
name="_ftnref32" title=""><span> [32] </span></a>.</p>
<p>Harker notes both the ‘fresh blood’ on Dracula’s lips and his apparent rejuvenation 
  from within the coffin when he first finds the count sleeping (p.71).  Plogojowitz’s 
  case, in many respects, seems to have offered a template for Stoker’s vampire; 
  Plogojowitz also had a stake driven through his body, his corpse subsequently 
  burned.  The Kisolovan villagers used garlic and whitethorn to protect themselves 
  from further vampire attacks.  The concept of staking the un-dead to ensure 
  their decapitation is a theme also found in Old Norse literature<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span> 
  [33] </span></a> and again, similar links can be traced with the removal of 
  the head and burning of the corpse to ensure total destruction.  Also, like 
  Dracula, the unnatural hunger of the <i>draugr</i> could be seen as a physical 
  manifestation of the beings desire for eternal life, the timely notion that 
  consumption of blood was akin to the consumption of the qualities and strengths 
  (the ‘life’) of its former owner<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span> 
  [34] </span></a>.</p>
<p>Freudian psychoanalysis, as Melton observes, ‘legitimised the human fantasies 
  of the un-dead as a topic for serious scientific research’ (1994:492) and a 
  range of psychoanalytic readings have been applied to Dracula since its publication 
  and perhaps it is this continual process of re-reading the vampire that makes 
  the myth (and the novel) so significant regarding studies of the unconscious.  
  Vampire narratives – perhaps by virtue of their cultural ubiquity – seem to 
  articulate a fascination that the living have with the dead.  Or perhaps the 
  prevalence of the vampire myth – and history’s apparent imbruing of the ‘myth’ 
  into ‘living’ case studies – account for what Jackson meant when she referred 
  to Dracula’s dissolution of the boundary between life and death (1981:118).</p>
<p>A Jungian psychoanalytic reading explains the popularity of vampire stories 
  through an exploration of the ‘shadow’<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span> 
  [35] </span></a>: aspects of the self that the conscious ego is unable to recognise.  
  The weight and variety found in cross-cultural constructions of the vampire 
  – and it’s binding with animals and insects in mythology – implies a universality 
  that can prompt one conclusion: there is something about the vampire, which 
  binds it to the psyche.  Perhaps there is a vampire living in everybody’s unconscious 
  and we all have a dim awareness that the vampire is <i>real</i>.  When Harker 
  is shaving in Dracula’s castle (p.38), he realises that no reflection is cast 
  in his mirror.  Dracula is the present absence: an unreal substance with no 
  fixed form.  Paul Monette’s <i>Nosferatu</i> exploits this symbiotic link further 
  when it binds Harker and Dracula together; Harker <i>becomes</i> Dracula (<i>see 
  </i>Jackson 1981:119).  Jackson uses Lacanian psychoanalysis to read the act 
  of vampirism as a symbolic reversal of the Oedipal stage of the subject’s development 
  and as an extreme attempt to invert (negate) the subject’s insertion into the 
  symbolic (<i>Ibid.</i>120).  The vampire act, when broken into two stages: the 
  canine penetration (<i>see also </i>Leatherdale, 1985) and secondly, a sucking 
  of the victims blood, embodies two re-enactments: firstly the subject’s insertion 
  into the order of the phallus, secondly: a return to a pre-Oedipal stage with 
  a repetition of sucking at the breast of the mother, and here blood and milk 
  are bound as life-supporting fluids and the vampire is reborn as the ‘death 
  mother’ (<i>see </i>Jackson, 1981:120).  As Jackson observes: with each penetration, 
  a new vampire is produced, creating order of ‘other’ beings (121).</p>
<p>During WW2, the US Army issued copies of <i>Dracula</i> to troops serving overseas, 
  while Dracula was invoked as a German soldier with fangs dripping with the blood 
  of innocents (<i>see</i> Enright, 1994:206).  During the Cold War he made the 
  transition from blood sucking capitalist (Moretti, 1988:91) and came to symbolise 
  ‘the fanatical hordes of the East’, threatening to conscript the West into their 
  way of life (Enright, 1994:206).  In recent years, the vampire was deployed 
  to represent the homosexual with HIV (<i>see</i> Ellis 1991), and a blood-sucking 
  Jew in the eyes of an American Black Muslim group (Melton, 1994:499).  The vampire 
  offers fuel for narcissistic rage - a myth for all seasons – universally ready 
  for deploy in any situation denoting the brink of crisis.  The fantasy of vampirism 
  is generated at the moment of maximum social repression (or <i>perceived</i> 
  repression), and is re-activated whenever the vampire can be successfully mapped 
  onto a group of outside ‘others’.  Finally: vampirism has been equated with 
  a series of crimes (some recent) involving the draining of blood, just as Stoker’s 
  Dracula was undoubtedly influenced to an extent by Jack The Ripper’s pleasure 
  gained from the drawing of blood (<i>see </i>Melton, 1994:131).  Such people 
  have become known as ‘real’ vampires<a href="#_ftn36"

<p><b>Week 9: Fantasy as the ‘Mise-En-Scene of Desire’</b></p>
<p>If psychoanalysis can be said to addresses a single key issue above all else 
  then perhaps it is the question of the role of sexuality in the constitution 
  of the subject.  How, then, is sexuality to be defined? In an incredibly dense 
  essay, Laplanche and Pontalis (1964) offer a re-reading of Freudian psychoanalytic 
  theory, setting a new condition for debates surrounding the <i>aetiology</i> 
  of the origins of sexuality.  Psychoanalysis is constantly held under interrogation 
  as debates on ‘origin’ are worked through.  Where instinctual drives are concerned, 
  Freud repeatedly opposes one with another<a
href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span> [37] </span></a>.  Origins of 
  a fantasy, it is argued, cannot be separated from the origin of the drive itself.  
  With this in mind, Laplanche and Pontalis set the tone by opening up a chronological 
  array of Freudian starting-positions<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span> 
  [38] </span></a>, developing each one before moving to another point, leaving 
  the initial impression of an erratic and confusing text.  Closer inspection 
  allows us more insight; they are, I think, using this structure to demonstrate 
  – emulate, even – Freud’s own erratic structuring and re-structuring of <i>his</i> 
  thoughts over several dimensions of non-intersecting theories: separate systems 
  developed to postulate his own structural arguments at different times <i>for</i> 
  different cases.  Their investigations throw up one lead which points towards 
  the ‘origins’ of auto-eroticism: here they conclude that sexuality <i>is </i>fantasy, 
  according to psychoanalysis<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span> 
  [39] </span></a>.  The moment of origin is more abstract than definable in time, 
  they argue, since it is constantly being renewed.  They are clear: it must have 
  been <i>preceded</i> by erotic excitation, in order for excitation to have ever 
  taken place.  On these lines, they partially explain the problems concerning 
  the notion of ‘origin’, but for the time being they are interested in defending 
  their argument against the inverse proposition that (the imposition of) fantasy 
  ‘could have occasioned the disjunction of sexuality and need’: ‘the answer to 
  the question of whether this is a case of circular causality or simultaneous 
  appearance is that, however far back one may go, they originate from the same 
  point (…) auto erotic satisfaction’ (25-6).  Fantasies are always elaborated 
  in terms of setting, so they are about placement – projection of individuals 
  and objects - into a scene.</p>
<p>Fantasy, then, is the ‘<i>mise-en-scene </i>of desire’.  A fantasy is the creation 
  of a desire to be brought back to something lost.  Fantasising, by nature, implies 
  that there exists a <i>before</i> moment in order for a fantasy to be able take 
  place – it is not possible to fantasise about absolutely nothing.  Therefore, 
  there is <i>always</i> a fantasy of the beginning and this is where the confusion 
  of origin finds its origins.  The <i>mise-en-scene </i>incorporates all that 
  is held within the shot and any fantasised setting involves elaboration; the 
  ‘objects’ moved into it no longer operate using the same laws as those in a 
  conscious space; the author of the fantasy assimilates the objects in such a 
  way as to achieve a desired effect.  As elaboration occurs the fantasist arranges 
  the objects into the <i>mise-en-scene</i> to suit the fantasy: as with a dream, 
  the subject’s position can shift between each and every element within the shot 
  depending on positions of identification. In <i>A Child is Being Beaten</i> 
  (1915), Freud demonstrates linguistically, how such a shift between subjects 
  occurs.  This happens in what he terms ’phases’.  The six fantasies he discusses, 
  are characterised by the ways in which they ‘have an earlier history, that they 
  go through a process of development, that they represent an end-product and 
  not an initial manifestation’ (184).  Freud’s ‘beating-fantasies’ are structured 
  in three phases: the first, exemplified (or represented) by the phrase ‘<i>My 
  father is beating the child</i>’<a href="#_ftn40"
name="_ftnref40" title=""><span> [40] </span></a>, is a recollection of events, 
  or desires, witnessed (185).  Phase two is expressed in the first person: the 
  child being beaten has changed into another person and is now producing a phantasy<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41"
title=""><span> [41] </span></a>, in this case it is masochistic and is accompanied 
  by pleasure ‘<i>I am being beaten by my father</i>’ (<i>Ibid.</i>).  The third 
  phase is similar to the first, however the father is never the ‘person beating’, 
  but a representative of the father: for example, a teacher.  The ‘figure’ of 
  the child producing the phantasy does not appear in it, but is implied as a 
  scopophilic viewer, an onlooker.  The technique Freud is adopting here seems 
  similar to the distinctions he makes when he traces the etymology of the words 
  <i>heimlich </i>and<i> unheimlich</i> in his essay on <i>The Uncanny </i>(1919).  
  So it is not just an <i>object</i> that the subject imagines, but, as Laplanche 
  and Pontalis are demonstrating<a
href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span> [42] </span></a>, in a fantasy 
  <i>sequence</i>, ‘there is a <i>sequence</i> in which the subject has his own 
  part to play and in which permutations of roles and attributions are possible’.  
  Whether an event takes place externally or internally is not an issue to psychoanalysis; 
  the subsequent <i>effect of the event</i>, however, is.  In this sense, (ph/f)antasies 
  (both conscious and unconscious) are of equal validity if they raise questions 
  concerning divisions between ‘healthy’ and ‘unhealthy’.</p>
<b>Week 10: Fantasy, Film and Spectatorship</b> 
<p>Metz’s essay (1976) offers the term <i>daydream</i> in an attempt to explain 
  the state of the spectator in relation to cinema.  A daydream is a conscious 
  production; likewise watching a film is a conscious activity.  Films, by nature, 
  are imaginary stories, offering for the spectator present tense images of absent 
  objects and people<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span> [43] </span></a>.  
  The spectator is positioned within and surrounded by the cinematic apparatus: 
  set in a darkened room, looking on at characters larger than life, projected 
  from behind onto a screen in front.  Perceptual activity, for the spectator, 
  is stepped up; they follow visual and sound activity (on a large screen) and 
  film editing sutures the spectator into the narrative.  Wright (1998) draws 
  an analogy with the Lacanian mirror phase (182); the ‘imaginary’ is located 
  as the site of initial constitution of the ego prior to the Oedipal moment<a href="#_ftn44"
name="_ftnref44" title=""><span> [44] </span></a>.  The primary identification 
  for the spectator, then, is with the activity of looking<a
href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span> [45] </span></a>; ‘the cinematic 
  signifier constructs a fetishistic relation for the spectator to the frame, 
  the characters, the story and even to the cinematic institution itself’ (Wright, 
  1998:183).  Metz, like many male theorists I have encountered throughout the 
  course, seems incredibly biased towards a male perspective, reminding us, for 
  example, that if film can be seen as a logical construction then ‘it is because 
  it is the product of men awake’.</p>
<p>Mulvey’s (1975) essay offers the flipside in the gender debate.  Her argument 
  is that mainstream Hollywood cinema<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46"
title=""><span> [46] </span></a> follows a format or narrative structure, which 
  shapes how spectators watch films.  Her aim is to take that structure apart 
  (deconstructing it) in order to demonstrate how narrative cinema, to quote Althusser 
  (1971), <i>interpellates</i> spectators into a masculine subject position.  
  Mulvey argues that the female image is threatening because the woman signifies 
  the threat of castration<a
href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span> [47] </span></a>.  While she states 
  that film creates an illusionistic world, one offering a forum for the ‘free 
  play’ of desires, she argues that the viewer is never <i>actually </i>free from 
  the circumstance which gives rise to the sexual instincts and identification 
  processes within the symbolic order: the castration complex.  However, spectators 
  manoeuvre through positions of identification, are not secured by a ‘whole’ 
  character/image, but form a network of fantasy relations across various positions 
  inscribed within the flow of images and narrative.  In this respect, her psychoanalytic 
  framework remains far too deterministic: While the explanation she provides 
  on the basis of this framework is compelling in many instances, it rather assumes 
  that viewers are <i>always</i> invited to adopt a narrow ‘way of looking’ at 
  films and that they <i>always</i> accept that invitation.  Her first assumption 
  implies that mainstream films are <i>only</i> structured around a male gaze, 
  whilst the second assumption suggests that mainstream filmgoers are incredibly 
  passive spectators, adopting the way of looking as dictated to them by the film.  
  The construction of sexuality is, after all, never a final matter.  Fantasy 
  is played out across a range of contradictory viewing positions rather than 
  from a point of coherence and our <cite>dispositions</cite> to identify take 
  us into varying and contradictory realms.  If this is so, perhaps we could ask 
  how such disparate positions of identification can be reconciled within the 
  spectator's patterns of engagement.  Finally: what are the implications for 
  female spectators if their identification with the female body (or form) becomes 
  so inscribed with the codes of masculinity?</p>
<p>Stam <i>et al. </i>(1992:130) offer a commentary on a process Freud initially 
  observed, (which was subsequently developed by Lacan) when writing up <i>Beyond 
  the Pleasure Principle </i>in 1915, which I feel addresses the <i>dynamics of 
  desire </i>from a young age, illustrating the perpetual chase for desire.  The 
  game, which subsequently became known as <i>fort/da</i>, was the invention of 
  Freud’s grandson at the age of 1½, and involved the toddler’s throwing a wooden 
  spool connected to string over the side of his cot, and then pulling it back 
  into the cot<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span> [48] </span></a>.  
  Freud’s hypothesis was that the spool could be taken to represent the (<i>fort</i>) 
  dis-appearance and (<i>da</i>) reappearance of his mother, but also represented 
  the pleasure derived from ‘staging the disappearance and return of the objects 
  within reach’ (Gay, 1995:600).  Lacan re-read this game in terms of semiotics: 
  the child making the spool into a ‘sign’ for its’ mother which the child interprets 
  through the binary of <i>what it is not</i>: ‘it is present because it is not 
  absent, and vice versa’ (Stam <i>et al.</i> 1992:130).  The part of the object 
  around which the fantasy is developed (<i>the spool</i>) becomes, in the Lacanian 
  algebra, ‘<i>object petit a</i>’ (Wright, 1998:107) and the game symbolizes 
  a repetition of a splitting (<i>Spaltung</i>) in the subject.  These concepts, 
  when taken together form what Stam <i>et al. </i>describe as the ‘basic matrix 
  from which all semiotic discussions of film derive’ (130).  The eyes – perhaps 
  the main mode of access for libido to explore the world - are not simply pleasure 
  seeking, but caught up in the whole system of signification.  In film, then, 
  the ‘small a’ could represent a character who has disappeared, the split is 
  between spectator and screen, and ‘fort/da’ is the mechanism of signification.</p>

    uncanny is an area where the unconscious can project those objects, which 
    the subjects refuse to recognise from within themselves.</p>

    to as the ‘structural hesitation’ (238) in emergence from Todorov’s model 
    of the fantastic where the reader has to make a decision - rather like Felman’s 
    (1982) commentary on <i>Turn of the Screw </i>– as to whether they fall ‘victim 
    of the illusion of the senses’ (1973:25), or whether the event <i>has</i>

    that these preliminary results have satisfied <i>psychoanalytic</i> interest 
    in the problem of the uncanny, and that what remains probably calls for an 
    <i>aesthetic </i>inquiry.  But that would be to open the door to doubts about 
    what exactly is the value of our general contention that the uncanny proceeds 
    from something familiar which has been repressed’ (370).  Freud, however, 
    has been criticised precisely for dissatisfying <i>psychoanalytic</i> interest 
    because of his entrapment within the ‘repetition-compulsion’.  Cixous (1976) 
    and Hertz (1979) offer two demonstrations of how this process occurs.  <i>See

    psychical reality, castration, the primal scene, phylogenesis), marked ambiguities, 
    or inconsistencies are found and opened up to their weaknesses.  Laplanche 
    and Pontalis (1973:249) remind us that by virtue of Freud’s construction of 
    conceptual [metapsychological – especially when examining the theorisation 
    of <i>unconscious</i> processes] models to explain his theories, ‘empirical 
    reality’ is often overlooked; such models are ‘more or less far removed’ from

    mention the distinction Susan Isaacs (1948) made between two words to denote 
    two functions: that of <i>phantasy</i> – ‘the primary content of unconscious 
    mental processes’ (<i>See </i>Laplanche and Pontalis, 1973:318) and <i>fantasy 
    –</i> ‘conscious daydreams, fictions etc’ (<i>Ibid.</i>).  However, as Laplanche 
    and Pontalis observe, such a distinction cannot be made to ‘do justice to 
    the complexity of Freud’s views’ (<i>Ibid.</i>).  As Freud always uses the 
    term <i>phantasie</i> in his writings, this could lead to arbitrary interpretations.  
    In this case, the translation is straightforward; Freud tells us that the 
    <i>phantasy</i> of the second phase ‘has never succeeded in becoming conscious’ 
    (185) and is a construction of analysis.</p>
