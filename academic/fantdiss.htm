<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Labyrinths of Desire:</b> <b>Identification, 
  Interaction and the 3D Game-Space</b></p>
<p>  As Annette Kuhn (1999:6) explains in her introduction to <i>Alien Zone II</i>, 
  one of screen theory’s new <i>topoi</i> is space.  In classical cinema, cinematic 
  space was codified primarily in terms of diegetic space and spectatorial space: 
  the organisation of space on screen within the narrative film and the space 
  organising the ensemble of screen, spectator and cinematic apparatus.  Although 
  both spaces are separate - diegetic space concerns the film <i>as </i>text, 
  whereas spectatorial space concerns the metapsychology of cinema (<i>see </i>Heath, 
  1976; Bordwell, 1985) – classical film theory informs us that both spaces overlap 
  within the cinema: the space where narrative form, the reality effect and the 
  cinema’s architectural arrangement all work together (<i>see </i>Metz, 1980; 
  Manovitch, 1999:184).  It is only when such a distinctive viewing situation 
  is made available to the spectator that film can <i>most effectively</i> relay 
  meanings and subjectivities produced by a <i>specific </i>cinematic apparatus.  
  Time has seen many alterations to the cinematic apparatus; itself now distinctly 
  redefined in recognition of an age of home video, pro-logic hi-fi surround sound, 
  digital pay-per-view services, wide-screen television and DVD.  As Kuhn reminds 
  us, the classical configuration of these spaces must now be regarded as ‘historically 
  and culturally specific’ (1999:7), cinema is indeed just one of a number of 
  possible venues for viewing films.  Kuhn argues for a re-consideration of the 
  spaces inhabited in relation to science-fiction narratives, when considered 
  both within the auditorium and when delivered by other moving-image media.  
</p>
<p>  If the study of space is fundamental to understanding, among other art forms, 
  the dynamics of cinema, then how should we consider this space in relation to 
  computer games?  Home computer games have been widely available since the early 
  1980s, and arcade games began to appear as early as 1971<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span> [1] </span></a>.  Curiously enough, both seem to have remained 
  largely neglected as legitimate fields of academic study.  As Andy Cameron explains: 
  he actively <i>encourages</i> his MA students to play games.  This provoked 
  the argument within the department – one, which if followed <i>could</i> equally 
  apply to students of film or popular culture - that the course would only encourage 
  lazy game enthusiasts.  Indeed Cameron argues that gaming is not [yet] ‘a proper 
  object of serious study’ (1995).  To compensate for the dearth of academic interest 
  into an industry already proving to out-strip the film industry<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> 
  [2] </span></a>, it is my intention to attempt to explain the desires encapsulated 
  by these games; to assess the potential, and limitations, of apparatus theory 
  and film criticism for the understanding of the psychical dynamics of gaming 
  in the relationship between the players and the game-spaces themselves.  Psychoanalysis 
  informed a significant proportion of early film theory and I believe it offers 
  useful tools to enable us to <i>better</i> understand the relationship between 
  the gaming <i>participant</i> on the one hand and the game-space on the other.  
  More importantly: from both sides, cinematic and computer technologies are converging; 
  advances in computer graphics increasingly inform the filmed space on the celluloid 
  and often become an extra process of filming.  As processing power and storage 
  capacity increases, interactive CD-ROM-based games are beginning to incorporate 
  an increasing number of cinematic techniques, often relying upon the layering 
  of large sections of digital ‘film’ narrative between interactive gameplay.  
</p>
<p>  It is my intention to consider two genres of computer game<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> [3] </span></a> and their relation 
  to apparatus theory and film criticism, to see the extent to which the texts 
  can better inform our understanding of them.  Both genres operate within the 
  parameters of Cartesian coordinates (<i>see </i>Vince, 1995:24), deploying the 
  player within the confines of their 3D rendered environments.  Yet in the broader 
  cultural field, both games have received differing attention, although I believe 
  that both are significant enough to demand critical attention.  These genres 
  are the ‘first person shooters’<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span> 
  [4] </span></a>, of which I will consider the body of games emerging from the 
  <i>Doom </i>(id software, 1993) game architecture, and the ‘third person adventure’ 
  game, where I will pay specific attention to the <i>Tomb Raider </i>(Core Design 
  / Eidos 1993) series.  Both games, when read alongside psychoanalytic film theory, 
  offer contrasting case studies in the light of <i>identification</i> and <i>desire</i>. 
</p>
<p><b>From Narrative to Interactive</b></p>
<p>  Narrative, Cameron (1995) argues, <i>is</i> the <i>dominant</i> cultural 
  form, and takes place in the past.  By this he means it offers an account of 
  events, but these events must have <i>already</i> taken place<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><span> [5] </span></a>.  In this respect, narrative’s 
  temporal referent is ‘once upon a time’ (<i>Ibid.</i>).  As Christian Metz explains: 
  ‘Most films shot today, good or bad, original or not, ‘commercial’ or not, have 
  as a common characteristic that they tell a story; in this measure they all 
  belong to one and the same genre, which is, rather, a sort of ‘super-genre’ 
  (1980:402).  As such, the spectator’s own relation to time is <i>never</i> strictly 
  affected by the tense of the verb within the narrative; they are rather placed 
  outside the narrative, and to this end, remain ‘absent from the screen’ (Metz, 
  1992:734).  What is perceived on the screen lies ‘entirely on the side of the 
  object’ (<i>Ibid.</i>) and out of the spectator’s reach.  If within the text, 
  present tense is summoned (to posit immediacy, or to bring dramatic tension 
  to an account), then it is so <i>only</i> for the ‘objects’ within the diegesis.  
  In comparing fictive work with ‘documentary’ fact, this statement holds true; 
  the function of time only functions as an account of what<i> has </i>happened, 
  irrespective of diegetic ‘truth’.  Narrative, considered here as a <i>form </i>of 
  re-presentation, can therefore be identified as having <i>taken place in the 
  past</i>.  By its very nature, narrative tells a story that has already been 
  written, even if diegetic events unfold in a manner that disregards linearity 
  of tense (as in the flashback) or operate within the parameters of real-time.  
  Interactivity, in contrast, implies a sense of immediacy <i>only </i>equable 
  with the present.  </p>
<p>  Interactivity refers to the possibility of the spectator’s <i>active</i> 
  participation within the controlling (or perhaps, <i>synthesis</i>) of an artwork 
  or representation.  Here it would be reasonable to argue that the process of 
  reading, of <i>interpretation</i>, is precisely a process of interaction: ‘to 
  read text is to make your own text of it’ (Unger, 1995 <i>cit.</i> Brody, 1999:138).  
  However, such an argument refers to a form of interaction where the spectator 
  intervenes <i>in a way that allows for a level of ‘meaning-making’</i> with 
  the representation itself; this form of interactivity to which I am referring 
  is one where a spectator’s intervention with the representation affects its 
  outcome.  As Ted Friedman observes, any exchange between a reader and a book 
  ‘is always one-sided; no matter what you do on your end, the text always remains 
  the same’ (1995:42).  To mark such a distinction between narrative and interactive 
  becomes of paramount importance when considered in relation to any meaningful 
  treatment of computer games; computer games embody precisely a dyad between 
  the externalisation and internalisation of the player, their function <i>par 
  excellence</i> lies in their switching between states of narrative, rendering 
  the player <i>external</i> to forward the game (as in the mode of the spectator 
  in relation to the narrative), to the state of interactivity (where the spectator’s 
  <i>active</i> participation affects and elicits a response from the other objects 
  within the game space).  </p>
<p>  Many <i>narrative</i> moments within games indicate these spaces by adopting 
  familiar narrative conventions.  In the introductory sequence to <i>Magic Carpets</i>  
  (Bullfrog, 1994), we see a floating book, its cover opening onto the first page, 
  with subsequent page-turns to indicate progress to later levels within the game.  
  In <i>Homeworld</i> (Sierra, 1999), the plot is forwarded by essential narrative 
  occurrences within the game, in order to enable progress.  At these points, 
  the mouse-pointer on the screen disappears, and both the top and bottom of the 
  screen shift upwards in imitation of a wide-screen (cinematic) mode.  <i>Unreal 
  Tournament </i>(Epic Megagames: 1999) allows the player a chance to ‘play as 
  spectator’; a mode which allows them to switch between the point-of-view of 
  other fighters in the game, or to navigate the game space as an omnipotent ‘camera’ 
  – able to float around the game-space and up through walls in a disembodied 
  manner, their actions bearing no effect whatsoever on the participants within 
  the game.  Such modes are reminiscent of a standard feature within arcade games; 
  the demonstration sequence, where a montage of sequences sliced from points 
  of the game, is run alongside a flashing textual sign ‘INSERT COIN’.  Sometimes 
  such ‘demo’ sequences will allow the user partial control over an object, perhaps 
  to make the game seem <i>even more </i>enticing when a coin is inserted and 
  more control is offered to the player.  In summary, the transition from narrative 
  form to a form of true interactivity lies in the ability of the spectator to 
  change position from one of mirror gazing<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"
title=""><span> [6] </span></a> (<i>and</i> interpreting), to a mode of <i>participation</i>: 
  to step, in the words of Sherry Turkle, ‘through the looking glass’ (1999:287) 
  and into the space within.</p>
<p>  Before I move towards a discussion of the <i>games</i> themselves, several 
  points should be made about the phenomenon of <i>interactivity</i>.   Firstly: 
  that whenever a product (or text) is interactive, it is so by only by nature 
  of the <i>limits </i>of interaction <i>coded into its space</i>; that computer 
  games are <i>interactive</i> is true in a sense that the participant can generate 
  a level of meaning within the game (<i>e.g.</i> to affect the game-space and 
  structure simply by choosing a ‘skill’ level upon which to play the game).  
  However, a degree of interactivity is always defined by specific parameters, 
  <i>pre-set </i>or imposed by the limitations of the game itself.  Secondly: 
  as with a <i>series</i> of films, assumptions quickly root, to become <i>coded</i> 
  into the narrative structure, although to an extent the narrative changes.  
  In a continuative sense, then, familiar notions of <i>genre</i> quickly become 
  enmeshed within the text itself<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"
title=""><span> [7] </span></a>.  In relation to gaming, this case is also true; 
  in the <i>Doom</i> series of games, stock characters are deployed into different 
  game-spaces and expected idiosyncrasies (sometimes as <i>mundane</i> as a sustained 
  continuation of standard ‘keyboard’ controls) become engrained in this fashion.  
  Finally, as cinema and gaming frequently look to each other for inspiration<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span> 
  [8] </span></a>, an inevitable intertextuality runs through interactive games.  
  In the Nintendo-64 release of <i>Goldeneye</i>, itself essentially a clone of 
  the <i>Doom</i>-style games, the participant is granted a larger-than life fantasy 
  with a long-running narrative history: the fantasy of the <i>coinus</i> of James 
  Bond.  In <i>Alien vs. Predator </i>(Activision, 1998), an interactive fantasy 
  is woven by suturing elements from two separate cinema narratives; here the 
  participant is granted an opportunity to adopt (also within a 3D <i>Doom-</i>style 
  labyrinth) a role of, choosing between two familiar cinematic ‘monsters’ and 
  game-spaces.  Here, such a close tie with film grants perhaps more depth to 
  the main protagonist.  In <i>Doom</i>, the leading character has no narrative 
  history (or biography): when games borrow ‘intertextually’ from filmic narrative, 
  the characters are fleshed out through another dimension; a dialogic history 
  covering earlier appearances.</p>
<p><b>From Cinematic Apparatus to Computer Apparatus</b></p>
<p>   Stephen Heath explains: ‘there are no jerks in time or space in real life 
  (…) Not so in film’ (1986:394).  This prompts the question: how can such a disparity 
  in the ‘continuity of [reality] space’ occur without arousing a sense of unease 
  within the spectator?  One answer lies in the apparatus itself: perhaps both 
  the darkened auditorium and the projection from behind the spectator contribute 
  to the creation of the ‘partial unreality<a
href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span> [9] </span></a> of the film picture’ 
  (<i>Ibid.</i> 395), allowing the spectator to subject the larger-than-life projected 
  images to reality testing; such logic illustrates the distinction between the 
  <i>Tagtraum </i>(<i>see</i> Metz, 1976:129) – the spectator’s state of dreaming 
  on the one hand - and on the other, as in the case of cinema, the secondary 
  elaboration of the phantasy scenario within the film.  Another answer lies in 
  the dynamics of film form (narrative ellipsis, the use of cutting to suture 
  two disarrayed spaces together, change of perspective through different grades 
  of lens).  In this mode, the film can be treated as a daydream precisely because 
  its diegesis <i>is</i> edited, ‘cut’ in the words of Mulvey ‘to the measure 
  of desire’ (1989:32).  The techniques of classical Hollywood narrative in many 
  cases were not unfamiliar to Western perspectives because they – to an extent 
  – already existed in other forms<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span> 
  [10] </span></a>.  Here, Baudry gestures towards links between cinema and the 
  perspectives developed during the Italian Renaissance period (1999:347).  He 
  also argues that Western easel painting initially set the dimensions of the 
  cinema screen: ‘the ratio between height and width’ (<i>Ibid.</i>). In time, 
  such conventions become incorporated into our understandings as much as in the 
  same way that the vernacular is eventually claimed by language.  Such recognition 
  of well-worn cinematic technique therefore justifies an understanding of the 
  ‘illusion’ created by cinema (<i>see </i>Mulvey, 1989:32).  Illusion, as de 
  Lauretis argues, ‘is typically equated with delusion and deception’ (1984:60).  
  Her discussion of illusion, as I hope to show later, becomes particularly pertinent 
  in relation to the game-space.</p>
<p>  As I hope to demonstrate, the challenges new forms of interactive media pose 
  to cinema will extend far beyond issues of the redefinition of narrative.  New 
  digital formats, and perhaps more specifically, cinematic computer techniques 
  (such as ‘morphing’)<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span> [11] 
  </span></a> are already re-processing the content of cinema and classical Hollywood’s 
  repertoire of conventions have been expanded to allow all that computer technology’s 
  seizure of the celluloid can offer.  Such potential for an ‘identity crisis’ 
  in cinema, calls upon us to consult its own history, its <i>own</i> repertoire 
  of techniques, to see what has changed.  Towards the end of <i>The Fiction Film 
  and Its </i>Spectator, Metz (1980) considers a scenario whereby non-narrative 
  films begin to be produced.  If this is so, then cinema will no longer need 
  to manufacture its ‘reality effect’<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"
title=""><span> [12] </span></a>.   A recent example of a film where traditional 
  cinematic techniques are laid, subsequently hijacked, and completely re-rendered 
  by computers is <i>The Matrix</i> (1999), where narrative speed is accelerated 
  (and decelerated) in ways traditional modes of production just would not allow.  
  Here, decelerating bullets, and allowing high-speed editing and 360° tracking 
  around a moving object are techniques of pure, unadulterated spectacle that 
  we would perhaps otherwise only experience on rides in theme parks.  As Angela 
  Ndalianis (2000) explains: </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">the 
  collapse and dispersal of ‘meaning’ as a result of the movement beyond narrative 
  concerns towards a form that prioritises the visuals and spectacle (…) manifests 
  itself especially in the move away from mainstream cinema’s supposed ties with 
  the nineteenth century literary tradition and its concerns with story telling 
  and narrativity, towards an aesthetic centered around action, movement, speed, 
  special effects (visual and aural), and engagement on the level of the sensation. 
  </font></p>
<p>  Such a cinematic assault on the senses - whilst offering the spectator enhanced, 
  increased (and a greater proportion of) visual spectacle – suggests a shift 
  in mainstream cinema towards offering an experience pitched closer to the interactive 
  game.  As cinema, it does <i>not</i>, of course, offer interactivity<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span> 
  [13] </span></a>, but its allegiance with the ‘roller-coaster’ theme park narrative 
  reminds me of the game-spaces found in games like <i>Descent</i> (Parallax, 
  1994) and <i>Forsaken</i> (Acclaim:1998) both 1<sup>st</sup> person 3D games 
  where the participant controls a gravity-defying vessel, which is deployed inside 
  a labyrinth of multitudinous rooms, each with a series of long tunnels arcing 
  off in different directions, which in turn lead to different rooms.  Conversely, 
  the film <i>Starship Troopers</i> (1997) incorporates the façade of a <i>Windows</i>-style 
  desktop ‘GUI’ as if offering an illusion of interactivity.  Here the film appears 
  to be borrowing some of the conventions of an Interactive CD-ROM game, and the 
  film functions in a reversal of the transition between interactive and narrative 
  I described in the game <i>Homeworld</i>: at points in the film, narrative pauses 
  and the spectator is offered images of the <i>non-interactive</i> desktop.  
  A message is displayed: ‘WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?’ mimicking a government 
  military advert.  After a short time, a selection is made <i>for</i> the spectator, 
  and the film narrative is allowed to continue.  Both films demonstrate the incorporation 
  of computer technology into the world of cinema, as both realms ‘merge into 
  one’ (Manovitch, 1996).  When one can ‘enter’ a virtual 3D space and participate 
  with the objects held within, the witnessing of a projection of images onto 
  a 2D surface perhaps seems less appealing.  At a time when (time and money allowing) 
  almost anything can be computer simulated, filming physical reality remains 
  just one possibility.  This perhaps explains why the cinematic apparatus itself 
  is redefining itself; moving into new realms - offering a <i>bigger </i>experience 
  than before to set itself apart from the world of ‘home entertainment’<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"
title=""><span> [14] </span></a>.  Computerisation has provided a means whereby 
  cinema has realised a new stage in a trajectory (<i>and</i> one which has arguably 
  <i>always </i>existed in the medium) of pleasure, both in and through immersion 
  within the text itself<a href="#_ftn15"
name="_ftnref15" title=""><span> [15] </span></a>.</p>
<p>  Let us turn again to spectatorship theory: at the centre of film theory in 
  the 1970s lays the notion of cinema as an <i>institution</i> (Maynard, 1993:13) 
  of which the spectator is part.  <i>If</i>, as I have argued, classical cinema 
  is a narrative institution and <i>if </i>psychoanalysis is understood as a discourse 
  for understanding positions of identification, then storytelling should be understood 
  as a fundamental juncture at which identity is constructed<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span> 
  [16] </span></a>.  When we visit the cinema, we take certain <i>basic</i> expectations 
  with us: that we sit in a space in a darkened auditorium, that we view images 
  projected onto its fourth wall, and follow narrative codes and conventions which 
  will, to an extent, seem familiar; perhaps we recognise them from elsewhere.  
  However, the question of identification demands new parameters; those of the 
  spectator/subjects’ <i>position ­</i>- and perhaps more significantly than this 
  – their moving position within a series of shifting position possibilities.  
  Identification, like identity itself, is by no means a solid construct.  In 
  <i>The Imaginary Signifier</i>, Metz (1982:48) considers the nature of the spectator’s 
  identification within the cinema in terms of a duality in <i>knowledge</i> of 
  identification; on the one hand, the spectator <i>may</i> identify, albeit positively 
  or negatively<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span> [17] </span></a> 
  with a character privileged by a shot at <i>any </i>stage in its narrative, 
  and the spectator <i>may</i> also be identifying ‘<i>with himself </i>(…) as 
  a pure act of perception (…) and hence as a kind of transcendental subject, 
  which becomes before every <i>there</i> <i>is</i>’ (<i>Ibid.</i>49); this is 
  the distinction between ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ identification for Metz.  
  To recap: any discussion of identification can therefore be considered as complicated 
  through its own <i>conception of </i>fluidity and movement.</p>
<p>  As we consider identification here (with specific emphasis upon the <i>corpus</i> 
  of Metz’s work), we realise that its functioning was examined within the framework 
  of an <i>apparatus</i>.  The context of cinematic apparatus itself was crucial 
  to the gauging of an understanding of the function of identification in film.  
  Therefore a significant problem I have in relation to my area of study is to 
  consider identification in relation to a standard <i>computer apparatus</i>: 
  a configuration (which I will shortly attempt to define), which becomes problematic 
  itself.  For Metz, whose film theory came before home video and home cinema, 
  study of cinema was aligned exclusively with the cinema <i>auditorium</i>.  
  The emergence of home video brought with it new theories and new modes of academic 
  study<a
href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span> [18] </span></a>; this change 
  in spatial alignment reshaped some of the ways in which we could consider the 
  body of 1970s <i>Screen </i>theories, themselves no longer working exclusively 
  within the parameters of the apparatus.  Consequently my study of computer apparatus 
  cannot be considered in the light of an <i>auditorium</i>, as most gaming activity 
  takes place in rooms with a series of networked computers<a href="#_ftn19"
name="_ftnref19" title=""><span> [19] </span></a>, within a room as a solo activity, 
  or within a room with friends.  Although many game players like to shut all 
  light from the room before they begin to play (as home spectators <i>may</i> 
  when renting a video), neither are rigid conventions.  In the case of gaming, 
  although a darkened room may increase dramatic tension and further the spectacle 
  of interaction, there can be no markers to indicate whether these affect level 
  or detail of the participant’s interaction within the game-space.  Where apparatus 
  theory can be standardised, however, is in terms of the specifications of hardware 
  required to run the game satisfactorily.  However, as with cinematic apparatus, 
  some cinemas may feature enhancements over others (a larger screen, more comfortable 
  seats, clearer projection quality, THX enhanced sound etc.), the same is of 
  course true for games<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span> [20] 
  </span></a>.  However, <i>set</i> computer apparatus may mean little more than 
  the basic system requirements for the game to be assembled and run within the 
  machine, an input device (keyboard, mouse, joystick), and a monitor for display.  
  Essentially there is no set uniformity of computer apparatus; indeed all computer 
  software demands physical space (as in memory) within the machine, within which 
  to ‘unpack’ and run, however no standard apparatus can be considered, only a 
  minimal computer configuration.</p>
<p>  Whenever we consider apparatus theory in the context of game-spaces, we realise 
  that there is a tendency - in both film and computer game alike - towards a 
  progressive and ongoing fantasy of <i>total immersion</i> embedded into the 
  apparatus.  Cinema, as both film and hardware strives to make films bigger and 
  more <i>immersive </i>than before, and in the game-space, as spectator becomes 
  participant, s/he: ‘puts on special clothing (…) Gloves<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"
title=""><span> [21] </span></a> transmit and receive data, and goggles include 
  two tiny video screens’<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span> [22] 
  </span></a>.  Although it is clear that for the popular 3D computer games of 
  now, such a fantasy need not stretch towards gloves and goggles, both hands 
  and the gazing eyes are <i>immersed</i> in this process of playing; from keyboard 
  and mouse to tilt-responsive joysticks with feedback, from bigger, all encompassing 
  screens and projections to 3D dual-screen headsets.  For hearing, a similar 
  story is told; from stereo sound to 3D surround.  Ultimately, this fantasy perhaps 
  strives towards the high street virtual experience; people emerge from body 
  building in the gym and into a virtual one a few doors down, to tone up their 
  fantasy life and interact with objects generated by body-engulfing apparatus.  
</p>
<p><b>From Flâneur to Mobilised ‘Virtual’ Gaze</b></p>
<p>  In <i>Window Shopping: Cinema and the Postmodern</i>, film historian Anne 
  Friedberg offers an archaeological study of a mode of perception, which according 
  to her characterizes the modern cinematic, the television and the ‘interactive’ 
  [cyber] culture: a <i>‘mobilized</i> “<i>virtual” gaze’</i> (1994:2). This mode 
  combines two conditions: ‘a <i>received</i> perception mediated through representation’ 
  (<i>Ibid.</i>) and the possibility of travel ‘in an imaginary flânerie through 
  an imaginary elsewhere and an imaginary elsewhen’ (<i>Ibid.</i>).  According 
  to Friedberg's archaeology, this mode emerged when a new nineteenth century 
  technology of virtual representation – <i>photography</i> - merged with the 
  mobilized gaze of tourism, urban shopping and flânerie.  Friedberg draws links 
  between Baudelaire's flâneur and a range of other modern practices: ‘The same 
  impulses which send flâneurs through the arcades, traversing the pavement and 
  wearing thin their shoe leather, sent shoppers into the department stores, tourists 
  to exhibitions, spectators into the panorama, diorama, wax museum, and cinema’ 
  (<i>Ibid.</i>:94).  What made the flâneur so significant as a model for such 
  practices, lay precisely in the fact that it equated most vividly the amalgamation 
  between a mode of perception (in the 1<sup>st</sup> person) and the concept 
  of navigation through a space.  All that remained in order to arrive at a ‘mobilized 
  virtual gaze’, then, was to construct this model ‘virtually’, something, which 
  as Lev Manovitch (2000) observes, ‘cinema accomplished in the last decade of 
  the nineteenth century’<a

<p>  While Anne Friedberg’s archaeology ends with television and does not move 
  into spaces articulated by interactive games, her model of the ‘mobilised virtual 
  gaze’ precisely encapsulates the objectivity so frequently offered by games 
  set in the first-person perspective, as in the <i>Doom</i> series<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span> 
  [24] </span></a>.  Indeed the negotiation of ‘virtual’ spaces in 3D games, visual 
  representations of data<a
href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span> [25] </span></a> and <i>virtual 
  reality</i> motion simulators all enshrine the logic of the ‘mobilised virtual 
  gaze’.  For the male flâneur – the impassioned observer and <i>perfect </i>spectator 
  – wandering the Parisian streets, passing shopping windows and observing the 
  faces of passers by (<i>see </i>Friedberg, 1994: 29-31), finds himself in <i>rejoice 
  of his own incognito<a href="#_ftn26"
name="_ftnref26" title=""><span> [26] </span></a></i> most when deployed in the 
  3D labyrinth worlds of the <i>Doom</i> games as a <i>virtual</i> flâneur.  In 
  a 3D realm, the <i>virtual</i> flâneur moves through virtual corridors, in and 
  amongst planes of data rendered into a walkthrough environment containing other 
  objects.  Here the eroticism of a split-second virtual affair with a passer-by 
  of the opposite sex is replaced with the excitement of locating and finding 
  the secret rooms embedded deep inside the labyrinths, or finding the coloured 
  keys that open up other areas of the space.  As with Baudelaire’s flâneur, the 
  virtual flâneur is happiest on the move, finding one object after another, traversing 
  room after room and level after level.</p>
<p>  In 1993, id software’s<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27"
title=""><span> [27] </span></a> release of <i>Doom</i> crashed college computer 
  networks across the US.  While scores of undergraduates stormed file transfer 
  (ftp) sites, all clamouring to download the fully playable (and free) shareware 
  version of the game, servers buckled under the strain of the traffic and began 
  to drop out.  By releasing detailed descriptions of the <i>Doom</i>’s file formats 
  and game level and character editing software, id enabled, <i>encouraged</i> 
  players to expand the game, to construct their own levels for it.  As a result, 
  hacking and adding to the game became an essential part of its charm; new homemade 
  levels and characters became widely available on the Internet for players to 
  download and play with friends.  Here was the birth of a new cultural economy, 
  ultimately transcending the usual parameters of relationship between producers 
  and consumers: its producers defined the basic structures of the game, the 3D 
  engine<a href="#_ftn28"
name="_ftnref28" title=""><span> [28] </span></a> and created initial sets of 
  objects (characters, weapons <i>etc.</i>) and textures for walls, ceilings, 
  floors and doors. They packaged these together with a few tips for making simple 
  alterations to the game, adding of course the necessary tools to allow the players 
  to build their own levels and avatars<a href="#_ftn29"
name="_ftnref29" title=""><span> [29] </span></a>.  The world of <i>Doom </i>game-spaces 
  exploded.  As J.C. Herz explains: ‘it was an idea whose time has come. Release 
  a free, stripped-down version through shareware channels, the Internet and online 
  services.  Follow with a spruced-up, registered retail version of the software’ 
  (Herz, 1997:90).  By 1997, 15 million copies of the original <i>Doom</i> game 
  had been downloaded around the world. (<i>Ibid.</i>84).</p>
<p>  The game architecture initially formulated for <i>Doom</i> now seems to have 
  taken on a life of its own.  Indeed id’s game engine is now sold under licence 
  to other software companies, which now makes up most of its revenue<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span> 
  [30] </span></a>.  The game-style has become a genre of its own right spawning 
  many <i>clone </i>games.  Part of the game’s appeal aside from a versatile 3D 
  engine enabling the creation an almost infinite range of fantasy mise-en-scenes, 
  lies in the games flexibility for network play; either over a local area (LAN) 
  network or the Internet.  This area of appeal perhaps explains why thousands 
  of users worldwide meet in 3D game-spaces online and was undoubtedly a deciding 
  factor for its adoption by the US Marines after the cold war as a team-strategy 
  training simulator (<i>see </i>Jordan, 1999:189-90).  Indeed, the recent release 
  of Sierra software’s <i>Half Life: Counter Strike</i> (2000) embodies more closely 
  this style of play; this clone moves away from the dimensions of the science-fiction 
  fantasy of <i>Ghostbuster</i>-style guns and monsters to a realm of team strategy 
  where the participant controls a member of a German, American, French or English 
  special force, armed only with a sniper rifle and a limited number of shots.  
  For each side, the task is to secure a building (often a warehouse-space) and 
  for once, strategy and stealth supersede endless pointing and shooting; the 
  constant ‘re-spawns’ that allow a player to rejoin the arena after their demise 
  is removed from <i>Counter Strike</i>; in this space, the participant’s death 
  banishes them to the realm of the narrative spectator, a position where they 
  leave their avatar and weapons where they died, now only able to observe the 
  rest of the game until the next match.  Since its release, this style of game 
  has proven increasingly popular, rendering it the most played game on the <i>Half 
  Life </i>servers<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span> [31] </span></a>.</p>
<p>  What I think is <i>really</i> new (and worthy of analysis) with the 3D <i>Doom</i> 
  game is the concept of the space articulated by this game engine.  This, as 
  with the enumerate texts referring to online chat rooms and Multi-User-Dungeons 
  (MUDs)<a href="#_ftn32"
name="_ftnref32" title=""><span> [32] </span></a>, raises a complex array of questions 
  concerning the <i>identity</i> of the individual within these spaces, so it 
  is my intention to address some of these now.  Computer theorists use the term 
  ‘cyberspace’ in reference to the notional social arena we ‘enter’ when using 
  computers to communicate (Hakken, 1999:1).  Historically we can trace this space 
  back to the arena (as Gibson describes it, a <i>nowhere somewhere</i>) that 
  we enter when we partake in a telephone conversation.  Or the television, which 
  ‘has developed a mode of presentation that envelops the viewer and presenter 
  in a virtual space of an imaginary conversation.  This “fiction of discourse” 
  or of presence is furthered by the habitual and distracted way in which we receive 
  television’ (Morse, 1998:163).  So: what kind of dialectic is opened up when 
  3D games come into the fore?</p>
<p>  In the realm of cyberspace we become arbiters of the identities and positions 
  paraded before us.  However, our existing cultural ties are bound to have a 
  considerable impact on the ‘Other’ we choose to identify with us, but we must 
  not ignore the co-presence of other identities, which ultimately call into question 
  the construction of our own.  For example, Ann Kalowski considers the notion 
  of ‘cyborg’ identity in cyberspace, with relation to its generation of a plurality 
  of ‘alternative’ models for living, explaining the ways in which a flesh-free 
  online identity can impact upon real-life identities and desires.  Her main 
  focus is the ‘drag act’ that V.R. can impose on the self, leading to new ways 
  of considering one’s sexual identity online, however, the notion of multiple 
  identity-shifting can, I think, be applied quite effectively to discussions 
  of the effects of computer games such as <i>Doom</i><a href="#_ftn33"
name="_ftnref33" title=""><span> [33] </span></a>.  One argument frequently postulated 
  by writings on the Internet defines the first stage of the construction of a 
  <i>virtual</i> reality as moving towards the manufacture of identity without 
  the corporeal body.  Here we are considering a differential notion of identity; 
  an identity produced in <i>or</i> through difference.  Following theories mapped 
  by Baudrillard in <i>Simulations</i> (1983), where suggestions that an element 
  of this shift towards ‘hyper-reality’ has been the met through erosion of the 
  realm of representation and the establishment of a dominant mode of simulation 
  (as Baudrillard explains through televisual coverage of the <i>Gulf War</i>).  
  In relation to gaming, then, it could be argued that such ‘new’ modes of representative 
  simulation have produced in cyberspace, increasingly real ‘simulations’ of a 
  comprehensible, or at least, <i>tangible </i>world.</p>
<p>  The ‘body’ as Balsamo explains, ‘is a social, cultural and historical production’  
  (1996:3).   Balsamo cites Michel Feher’s comments that the body, in its own 
  right, is a ‘reality constantly produced, an effect of techniques promoting 
  specific gestures and postures, sensations and feelings’ (<i>ibid.</i>).  To 
  think of the body as <i>both</i> an object primarily borne out of nature, and 
  then as a landmark (sign) of the culture it originated from, implies – to some 
  degree – a <i>reading</i> of the body.  To elaborate an informed perception 
  of the body in contemporary culture is to map a discourse of it, and then to 
  construct an interpretation from that discourse.  What Balsamo is saying, here, 
  is that a ‘body’ is a text to be read like any other; that assumptions can be 
  drawn through observation of the body.  Tattoos, chains and piercings that adorn 
  skin, accompanied by a certain dress code, all invite a reading and contextualising 
  of the body with the personality.  Although if we follow the argument that identity 
  in cyberspace is often about ‘passing off’ the body, offering in its place a 
  fluid sense of self which is projected onto an imaginary virtual body (an avatar 
  in a 3D game) we see that the bodily reading can no longer take place.  Here 
  ‘identity is represented [as <i>simulation</i>], rather than ‘real’’ (Texter, 
  1996:3).  Therefore the consensus of cyberspace is indeed precarious; identification 
  is entirely contingent, based on a consensual agreement of <i>blind </i>faith 
  on both sides: as Texter suggests, to ‘take one’s word’.  </p>
<p>  Judith Butler, whom Texter cites, argues that gender, much like the shifting 
  viewing position in spectatorship theory, ought not to be constructed ‘as a 
  stable identity’ (<i>cit. Ibid</i>: 4) and in this sense should be considered 
  as ‘<i>tenuously constituted </i>in time, <i>instituted</i> in an <i>exterior</i> 
  space through a <i>stylised repetition</i> of acts’ (<i>Ibid.</i>)<a
href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span> [34] </span></a>.  Here Butler’s 
  comments deserve considerable attention; for her, time-space (that which <i>has 
  </i>taken place) is not an <i>essential</i> factor in the formation of a <i>stable</i> 
  identity, although by its very <i>constitution</i> (even if tenuous), Butler 
  (like Balsamo) is implying that a <i>narrative</i> reading (of the body <i>as 
  a text to be read</i>) is taking place.  However, the second half of her sentence 
  now complicates this: this <i>reading</i> is only <i>tenuously</i> <i>constituted</i> 
  in time.  If we explore this argument further, we can gain a further understanding, 
  which is, I think, relevant to our understanding of the game-space: an <i>exterior 
  </i>space suggests that which takes place <i>outside<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span> 
  [35] </span></a></i>.   Such a reading of the body, then, has two connotations: 
  that a reading is performed upon the surface of the body (precisely a reading 
  of the <i>exterior</i>) and also, that such a reading should occur, by its very 
  nature it is being performed by an Other, who is looking upon (a reading from 
  the <i>exterior</i> by a spectator).  This suggests that a categorisation of 
  ‘gender’ at its primary stage concerns physical <i>difference </i>between the 
  sexes.  The <i>stylised repetition</i> of acts, then, refers to a surmounting 
  knowledge of physical difference, coupled with a study of gendered idiosyncrasies, 
  arranged in binary opposition to one another (along a masculine/feminine divide), 
  which provides the basis for the construction of a set of stereotypes.</p>
<p>  In a <i>Doom­</i>-style game-space, the participants use their own body to 
  control an avatar, a pre-programmed graphical representation that they have 
  selected (or themselves authored) as representative of themselves within the 
  context of the game-space.  In the <i>Doom</i>-style game, the participant masquerading 
  as a character<i> </i>is transcending codes of gender precisely because their 
  own body surface remains hidden and hence, <i>unreadable</i> from the ‘Other’ 
  participants.  Without a surmounting knowledge of the bodily surface (the basis 
  upon which stereotypes are called into play), we can for once consider a fluidity 
  of character: one, which eradicates a binary opposition.  Perhaps what these 
  forms of interaction do, by removing the visual cues that partially gender us, 
  are to open up possibilities for experimentation and play with existing manifestations 
  of <i>subjectivity</i>.  Here a space has been articulated by a number of theorists 
  on gender and consumption: Ang and Hermes, for example, stress that ‘gender 
  identity, in short, is both multiple and partial, ambiguous and incoherent’ 
  (1991:321).  Donna Haraway’s influential <i>Cyborg Manifesto</i> (1985/1991) 
  provided the seminal study of this phenomenon in relation to computer-mediated 
  ‘human’ identity; upon its use (as in a game), the machine <i>becomes</i> us; 
  an aspect of our embodiment.<span>  </span>To me, her work marks the beginning 
  of a new way of looking at a future without straight gender binaries.  Where 
  the body is ‘hidden’ from view, existing boundaries and categories no longer 
  hold weight and are thus collapsed; as a result, the gap between genders becomes 
  much harder to read, causing a closer <i>unity </i>of gender-identification, 
  away from a central divide.  However, as her opening quote suggests (<i>See 
  </i>p.9), what is also at stake here, is the amalgamation of ‘human’ and ‘machine’; 
  moving towards a ‘post-human’ politics where the boundaries between human and 
  non-human also begin to amalgamate, causing the creation of the ‘cyborg’, and 
  hence a further ‘fetishistic’ desire to improve our own bodies through the use 
  of technology.  </p>
<p><b>Artificial Intelligence</b></p>
<p>  Before I move my analysis towards notions of gender and games like <i>Tomb 
  Raider</i>, I would like to consider the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
  in relation to the 3D game-space.  We can take it that people who have experienced 
  AI have most likely experienced it within the realm of computer games.  In most 
  new racing simulations, other cars on the track are programmed to try and block 
  the player as they attempt to overtake.  In a martial arts game like <i>Mortal 
  Kombat</i> (Midway, 1996-), we can’t ask questions of our opponent, nor can 
  we expect him to start a conversation with us.  All we can do is ‘attack’ the 
  AI character by pressing a few buttons; and within this severely limited communication 
  bandwidth the computer can “fight” us back very effectively.  In short, computer 
  characters can display intelligence and skills only because they place severe 
  limits on our possible interactions with them<a href="#_ftn36"
name="_ftnref36" title=""><span> [36] </span></a>.  Recently, I was playing a 
  multiplayer level of <i>Half Life</i> with two of my flatmates and five computer 
  controlled ‘bots’.  All my opponents appeared as the same character (at this 
  time, I did not have extra character ‘skins’ installed, so a <i>default</i> 
  character was selected to replace this).  I was also playing the game at a low 
  resolution.  In this mode, and for quite a considerable time, it made no difference 
  who was human and who was not.  It wasn’t until the ‘human’ characters in the 
  game started behaving more erratically; in this my housemates avatar approached 
  me and challenged me to put away my guns for a ‘crowbar dual’ that I was able 
  to distinguish between the computer controlled ‘bot’ and the human player.  
  After a while some of the bots noticed us using crowbars and slowly they too 
  joined in.  AI characters can mathematically ‘pretend’ to be intelligent by 
  tricking us; by adopting a small part of who we are when we communicate with 
  them.  </p>
<p><b><s>The</s> woman does not exist: Lara Croft, Visual Pleasure and Interactive 
  Gaming </b></p>
<p>  The famous Lacanian utterance represents a denial of existence: not of the 
  <i>actual </i>existence of the woman, but of a universal feminine essence.  
  All that exists in this light remains is a fantasy of femininity.  Jaqueline 
  Rose regards this as a location onto which ‘lack is projected and through which 
  it is simultaneously disavowed’ (1986:2).  In this context, Rose considers woman 
  as a ‘symptom’ for the man.  Defined as such, and reduced to nothing other than 
  a fantasmatic place, ‘the woman’ (as absolute category and guarantor of fantasy) 
  does not exist.  As Stam <i>et al.</i> remind us: psychoanalysis regards femininity 
  as a category, ‘produced psychologically and socially, rather than as a set 
  of biological or anatomical features’ (1992:137); hence Freud’s comment that 
  psychoanalysis does not try to describe what a woman is, ‘but sets about inquiring 
  how she comes into being (<i>cit. Ibid.</i>).  What, then, can psychoanalysis 
  tell us about <i>Tomb Raider’s </i>virtual<i> </i>star Lara Croft?  On the Paragon 
  Online website, Stuart Wynne explains that the game functions by:</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">‘Asking 
  someone to embody a binary cipher inevitably courted controversy.  After all, 
  Lara was designed as a cybernetic alter ego for you or I - a feminist caricature 
  for blokes, basically.  Making her real extended a bit of mildly kinky transexuality 
  into dizzying realms of gender confusion’ &lt;<a href="http://www.dsuper.net/~misskris/croft.html">http://www.dsuper.net/~misskris/croft.html</a>&gt; 
  </font> </p>
<p>  What Wynne seems to be suggesting here, is that for the <i>male</i> player 
  to interact with <i>Tomb Raider</i>, he must re-configure himself along the 
  lines of gender; effectively to transgender himself via the cipher of the ‘female’ 
  Lara.  In the cinema, characters embody significant gender roles, although in 
  the vast majority of computer games, characters seem genderless. In the <i>Doom</i>-style 
  game, we see the virtual world through our <i>own</i> eyes.  The armed participant 
  inside the game-space sees only a hand holding one of an assortment of weapons.  
  In earlier versions of the game, a control-panel with indicators for health, 
  armour, ammunition and inventory would be accompanied by a generic ‘protagonist’ 
  face, which becomes more bloody as the participant loses health points<a
href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span> [37] </span></a>.  In later games 
  in the <i>Doom </i>series, such as <i>Quake</i> (id software, 1996), when we 
  are low on energy the participant will hear their avatar’s breathing as it becomes 
  increasingly laboured.  Once the participant has been killed, they view the 
  game-space from a prone position – as lying on the floor of the labyrinth (curiously 
  in this world, subjectivity uncannily <i>survives</i> death).  The sound of 
  breathing and the grunts the avatar makes when falling or landing from jumping 
  are decidedly masculine, and, as such, <i>Quake</i> offers us an uncomplicated 
  masculine gender identity based on the notion of identification with a male 
  protagonist who drives the narrative towards a possible </p>
<p>(although not inevitable) resolution (unless, of course, the player is invulnerable)<a href="#_ftn38"
name="_ftnref38" title=""><span> [38] </span></a>.  The <i>Doom</i>-style ‘first-person 
  shooter’, and its many <i>clones</i>, all conform closely to observations made 
  by Laura Mulvey on the centrality, the dominance of the male gaze in narrative 
  cinema.  By locating the active male spectator at the centre of the narrative, 
  <i>early </i>Hollywood<i> </i>cinema invites him (as a <i>male</i> spectator) 
  to identify with the leading (<i>male</i>) character, which through force of 
  personality and cinematic privileging through cinematic technique, brings about 
  narrative resolution<a
href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span> [39] </span></a>.  </p>
<p>  It noteworthy, I think, that the subjectivity of the game-space offered by 
  the <i>Doom-</i>style games, chimes in closely with Mulvey’s observations: </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">‘As 
  the spectator identifies with the main male protagonist, he projects his look 
  on to that of his like, <i>his screen surrogate</i>, so that the power of the 
  male protagonist as he controls events coincides with the active power of the 
  erotic look, both giving <i>a sense of omnipotence</i>’ (Mulvey, 1975:28) [my 
  emphasis]</font></p>
<p>  That the participant identifies with a ‘main male<i> </i>protagonist’ seems 
  relatively clear cut; indeed, I think it is hard to argue that this commercial 
  manifestation of <i>virtual reality</i> offers us anything but a very clear, 
  uncomplicated subject position to inhabit.  Here ‘identification’ is aided by 
  the alignment (<i>or</i> conflation) of the male protagonist with the self, 
  perhaps intensifying the satisfying <i>sense of omnipotence</i> the game warrants.  
  In such games, the symbolic ‘armour’ and ‘health bonus’ parcels deployed throughout 
  the game-space instantly serve to revivify the protagonist as he is moved over 
  them, further omnipotence is perhaps granted by the participant’s ability to 
  <i>save</i>, or <i>pause</i> the game-state as and when ‘he’ wishes.  If the 
  participant is killed, pressing one key (often the space bar, or ‘fire’ button) 
  allows ‘him’ to re-spawn<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span> [40] 
  </span></a>; his only punishment being that he may be deployed further back 
  in the labyrinth and loses any weapons or ammunition he may have collected in 
  his previous ‘life’.  What does problematise the application of Mulvey’s analysis 
  to the <i>content </i>of the majority of <i>Doom </i>games, is that women are 
  frequently excluded from the space.  In only one game I have seen, <i>Duke Nukem 
  3D</i> (Epic Megagames, 1995), are women incorporated into the narrative; and 
  here they are fetishised to embody a purely ‘masculinised’ address<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span> 
  [41] </span></a>, packaged as strippers, exotic dancers or as 3D representations 
  of cinema-projections, pandering to masculine pleasures of voyeurism.  What 
  we do not get with many of the <i>Doom-</i>style games is much space within 
  the text to contest existing gender categories.  Here a consideration of <i>Tomb 
  Raider</i> will offer us a far wider-reaching set of examples.</p>
<p>  Lara Croft is a cultural icon; she is perhaps more famous than most glamour-celebrities.  
  She has appeared on the cover of countless magazines, has appeared in <i>U2</i> 
  videos.  <i>Generation-X</i> author Douglas Copeland has co-written a book about 
  her. Since 1996, more than nine million copies of <i>Tomb Raider </i>have been 
  sold worldwide.  <i>Details</i> magazine declared her one of the ‘sexiest women 
  of 1998’.  Advertisers have used her to endorse <i>Lucozade </i>and <i>SEAT 
  </i>cars and ‘real-life’ representations have been propelled to fame for standing 
  in as her human <i>equivalent</i>.  Her notoriety has even got her into the 
  Guinness Book of Records.  Yet she is not real: Lara Croft does <i>not</i> exist 
  as a woman.  Indeed, as one writer argued: ‘Lara is anatomically impossible 
  (…) [and] if you genetically engineered a Lara-shaped woman, she would die within 
  around 15 seconds since there's no way her tiny abdomen could house all her 
  vital organs’<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span> [42] </span></a>.  
  Lara Croft is composed of a melange of idealised body parts perhaps vaguely 
  based on some live models<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span> 
  [43] </span></a>.   It could be argued that she is also modelled in a similar 
  style to Japanese ‘Manga’ animation; with larger than life eyes and a body which 
  is too out of proportion to be anatomically accurate.  Lara, as can be seen 
  from the screen shot<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44"
title=""><span> [44] </span></a>, is designed to <i>appear </i>both attractive 
  and physically powerful:</p>
<p align="center"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
'><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">‘[This fetishism] 
  builds up the physical beauty of the object transforming it into something satisfying 
  in itself’ (Mulvey, 1975:25) </font></span></p>
<p>  This perhaps explains why, when I first played the game, I spent some time 
  making Lara perform a variety of acrobatic manoeuvres, all of which were far 
  removed from the task of ‘killing’ itself; in this sense, precisely learning 
  <i>how </i>to control her as <i>my </i>avatar.  Perhaps much of the ‘gender’ 
  ambivalence writers such as ‘Miss Kriss’<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span> 
  [45] </span></a> are identifying, lies in the unusual tension between its basis 
  within the male gaze and its simultaneous identification with an active female 
  protagonist.  If women, as it has been suggested, can feel empowered by and 
  attracted to <i>Tomb Raider</i>, suggests a marked shift in conceptions of subjectivity 
  and identity.  However, this shift is not total and still appears to be rooted 
  in existing gender definitions.  </p>
<p>  As the author explains, psychoanalysis often tends to affirm ‘heterosexual 
  norms and finds its basis in a heterosexual division of the universe’ (<i>Ibid.</i>).  
  Although Lara does drive the narrative, she is also heavily eroticised by psychoanalysis.  
  Mulvey suggests that female characters in narrative cinema often halt the narrative 
  flow (Mulvey, 1975: 30) for moments of ‘erotic contemplation’.  Initially, the 
  active narrative role of the protagonist in <i>Tomb Raider</i> seems to defy 
  this, but the game does encourage psychoanalysis to gaze at Lara ‘though male 
  eyes’.  We can manipulate our view of the character to see her from a range 
  of angles using movements of the frame that closely resemble cinematic zooms, 
  tracking shots and pans. These features make the game-play rather clumsy but 
  allow us to completely fetishise the protagonist.  However, such a model for 
  identification clearly does not take into account the possibility that for woman, 
  and sometimes men, identification can occurs across gender lines, perhaps in 
  transgender or bisexual negotiations within the individual, as ‘Miss Kriss’ 
  quite rightly points out.  If we follow Steve Wynne’s further suggestion that 
  men are ‘transgendering’ themselves when they play <i>Tomb Raider</i>, Mulvey’s 
  model becomes complicated.  This, as ‘Kriss’ observes, does not imply that ‘men 
  are looking at Lara through women’s eyes’ but postulates an argument that to 
  play Lara in a 3D game-space is to experience also to experience ‘being a woman 
  in (…) in a secure virtual world’  </p>
<p><b>Psychoanalysis and Responsibility</b></p>
<p>  Skirrow’s (1986) analysis of ‘video games’ remains, to date, the only attempt 
  to use psychoanalysis on the <i>gaming</i> experience that I have found.  Her 
  discussion raises some relevant points; although in many respects, I feel she 
  has performed a somewhat metaphorical smothering of games through the authority 
  of the psychoanalytic lens.  At outset, Skirrow raises a bold statement: that 
  the pleasure of video games is ‘gender-specific’; women, she argues ‘do not 
  play them’ (127).  What is interesting here, is that Skirrow, much like Henry 
  Jenkins, begins by asserting gender binaries (in terms of game-spaces, Jenkins 
  rather crassly calls these ‘blue’ and ‘pink’ ghettoes).  However, unlike Skirrow, 
  Jenkins does at least acknowledge that both genders will in fact ‘play’ games, 
  although their desires can easily be polarised into a ‘traditionally masculine 
  interest in plot action and a traditionally feminine interest in character relations’ 
  (292).  Some games, he maintains, contain fusions of both gender, although the 
  spaces within these games often construct a tasteless and rather trite ‘gendered’ 
  fantasy scenario of dreams: ‘sports for boys and musical performance for girls, 
  graffiti-laden inner-city basketball courts for boys and pastoral gardens for 
  girls’ (294).  He considers an androgynous game where in order to win, ‘the 
  player must become both the male and the female protagonists’ (<i>Ibid.</i>).  
  For Jenkins, the challenge for the industry is to ‘invent new kinds of virtual 
  play spaces’.</p>
<p>  My belief is that gendering the game-space is often problematic.  Drawing 
  from the work of Klein, Skirrow establishes the link between boys and the ‘hostile’ 
  spaces of the games.  Upon studying the representational content of play in 
  relation to boys, Klein discovered their ‘displacement of everything that is 
  frightening and uncanny onto the invisible inside of the woman’s body’.  Upon 
  this premise, Skirrow begins to build her argument: ‘video games (…) aim more 
  at satisfying the player’s curiosity about the interior of the body from which 
  the supply – and the player himself – originates’ :123).  Later, this observation 
  is encouraged further, when:</p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> ‘The 
  boy, putting all his faith in the omnipotence of his penis-as-magic-wand (…) 
  turns the danger from an internal to an external one and ‘embodies’ it as his 
  father’s penis inside his mother’s body (…) Once having entered the mother’s 
  body in fantasy he risk [sic] the danger of being castrated by his father’s 
  penis, which is waiting for him in there, or of having his own penis prevented 
  from retreating, and being shut inside his mother’s body’ (<i>Ibid.</i>132)</font></p>
<p>  Good performance in the womb-like labyrinth allows intact escape for the 
  boy.  Skirrow clearly had definite intentions for her reading of gaming; she 
  set out to study a ‘new’ cultural phenomenon within the parameters of a Kleinian 
  framework, which is perhaps more than can be said for my conclusion.  Donald 
  provides an enlightening and significant counter-argument here: that the emphasis 
  on fantasy ‘as an organising force both within psychic life and within a variety 
  of cultural forms (…) is clearly quite different from many more orthodox forms 
  of Freudian interpretation.  All too often, those involved a hunt for sexual 
  symbolism, spotting a penis and a breast here or a mouth and a womb there, searching 
  out such bodily parts in apparently the most innocent texts’ (Donald, 1989:136).  
  While I am not completely arguing for the textual ‘innocence’ of the games, 
  I think both Jenkins and Skirrow have proven an important point: that the 3D 
  game-space itself should remain outside gender binaries of analysis.  I like 
  to think of this space as a structure within which a mise-en-scene can be constructed.  
  The space itself is rather a template, one, which through the agency of interactivity 
  provided by the dynamics of the game ‘engine’, can be constructed for a gendered 
  reading to take place.  That the meaning of the corporeal ‘body’ is changing 
  in light of new social, symbolic and cultural practices, and that a subsequent 
  erosion of subjectivities and identities seems to be closely bound up with the 
  heightened sense of mediation offered by 3D spaces is a possible avenue for 
  further investigation.  However, 3D game-spaces articulate new structures of 
  address, inflecting upon new ways in which we can view the world, and equally 
  importantly, how it views us.</p>

    the past within the <i>guise</i> of a futuristic mise-en-scene (although here 
    ‘the past’ must be carefully defined in relation to its present).  This is

name="_ftn6" title=""><span> [6] </span></a> Comments distilled from Stam <i>et 
    al.</i> (1992:128-9) can perhaps make <i>explicit</i> this distinction; in 
    this phase the infantile subject - in Lacanian terms – comes into being (in 
    terms of <i>ego formation</i>) through identification with an image of its 
    own body.  This image is internalised as an <i>ego ideal</i>, which is subsequently 
    used to form the basis of all later identifications, all of which at this 
    stage, at least, are imaginary in principle (this form ‘situates the agency 
    of the ego, before its social determination, in a fictional direction’ [Lacan, 
    1977<i> Cit. Ibid.</i>]).  Thus the Imaginary (‘one of three psychic registers 
    regulating human experience’[<i>Ibid.</i>]) involves ‘a narcissistic structure 
    in which images of otherness are transformed into reflections of the self’.  
    In this context, the mirror ‘stage’ (although in this context it is perhaps 
    more useful to consider this stage as an <i>ongoing </i>process), which Lacan 
    argued was one of the key stages for ‘identification’ in the cinema (<i>See 
    </i>pp.130), becomes something more when a shift is considered between ‘narrative’ 
    and ‘interactive’, so when the flat surface of the mirror (as in the cinema 
    screen), is stepped inside, so Lacan’s metaphor is extended in relation to 
    something more akin to Lewis Carrol’s <i>Looking Glass</i> in the realm of 
    the interactive game.</font></p>

    ‘cheat’ functions built into them at design stage.  This, I believe, is largely 
    to make game-testing a little easier, but functions in similar ways to the 
    ‘secrets’ embedded deep within the labyrinths; when a combination of keys 
    can render the knowledgeable participant all-powerful or omnipotent these 
    functions become just another aspect of the game to discover.</font></p>

    Mulvey’s theories <i>can </i>still be ported straight over to a number of 
    recent Hollywood films (for example, <i>The Mask</i>, <i>There’s Something 
    About Mary</i>) her paradigm is by no means concrete.  Mulvey was dealing 
    with a specific period of cinema: ‘exemplified at its best by Hollywood in 
    the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s’ (1975:23) and she acknowledges that alternative 
    cinema, and thus, alternative modes of representation (re-presentation) have 
    occurred since then.</font></p>

    problems with such games is precisely this compulsion to repeat; although 
    many newer-generation multiplayer games (such as <i>Counter Strike</i>) move 
    towards a greater realism; away from running and shooting, towards ‘hiding’ 
    and patience.  (<i>see</i>: footnote 31)</font></p>
