    society and culture into an entirely new dimension.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>In 1995, the Internet had anywhere between 10 and 25 million people
    connected to it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    Independent Association of Internet users known as the ‘Internet Society’
    estimates that by 2001 there will be over 5 billion computers (N.B. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">computers, </i>not users.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    figure for users is potentially, perhaps inevitably, even larger), connected
    to the network. (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">‘New Scientist’</i>,
    18/2/95, p.33).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it’s
    not just the network and the hardware necessary for it to operate that will
    see a global ‘explosion’, but the increasing capabilities of this
    technology, which, according to Moore’s law (1971), has been doubling in
    magnitude every two years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To
    this day, this has proven to be correct (Gates, 1995 p.88).</p>

padding:0cm;mso-padding-alt:0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm"><span style="mso-spacerun:

    development, I wish to use an article featured in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Independent
    on Sunday</i>: “By the end of this decade it will be possible to put 10
    Bibles in a single computer chip. By 2005, a chip will be able to hold all
    32 volumes of the ‘Encyclopaedia Britannica’, pictures as well as text.
    In 25 years time, computers will be a million times faster than they are
    today in a way that mimics the human brain.&quot;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>

    </span></a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also worth
    considering here is the falling price of the technology available which will
    move IT out of offices and cyber-cafes, into every home; ‘falling PC
    prices may eventually rival those of televisions’ (‘<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Guardian
    Online’</i>, 2/3/95, p.7).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    effects of falling prices are already noticeable, in that on a global scale,
    more PC’s than cars are being purchased. (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ibid.</i>).<![if !supportEmptyParas]>

padding:0cm;mso-padding-alt:0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In this essay, my main point of focus will concern modern
    Information Technologies and their effect on our perceptions of notions of
    ‘community’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As these
    technologies become increasingly more transparent in the future, it is
    believed that they will eventually become a part of everyday life, just as
    Television or Radio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At this
    stage, I’d like to make a point clear: the Internet is not a static
    entity; it is in a constant state of flux as increasing numbers of ‘digital
    artisans’ subscribe to it and shape its user interface.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>As Bill Gates observes: ‘The Internet of today is not is not the
    Internet of even a short time ago … It is very hard to stay up-to-date
    with something so dynamic’ (Gates, 1995 p.98).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Unlike traditional media, the Net is not just a spectacle for passive
    consumption but also a participatory activity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>As a culture it is, to quote Richard Barbrook, a ‘DIY’ culture
    and one where all users are fully immersed and able to interact with other
    users in a given area of cyberspace, in real time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>This has led to the construction of ‘netiquette’, a protocol set
    down by the hosts of a given virtual arena where failure to abide to the
    rules results in the offending user being ousted from the room and
    subsequently locked out of that community. ‘As the information highway
    becomes society’s town square, we will come to expect it to conform to our
    culture’s mores’ (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">ibid.</i> p.161).<![if !supportEmptyParas]>

padding:0cm;mso-padding-alt:0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Cultures are shaped and moulded by the technologies in use at
    any particular time. The launch of television for example, has changed our
    leisure pursuits, the way we spend our free time and even family dynamics
    – who is in control of the channel watched and any given time.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the Internet, computers, and IT can be seen to
    influence the way we behave, how we choose to spend our time and money and
    our social behavioural patterns and relationships.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>However, it is impossible to predict any set trend as use will vary
    from person to person according to a large set of variables, such as
    exposure to technology at work or at school, interest, access to hardware
    and software, finances available, language and literacy issues etc.</p>

yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since 1995, the Internet has become the iconic
    technology of our age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Through
    its adoption of pseudo sci-fi and hyperbolic techno-slang, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">‘Wired’</i>
    magazine has achieved an almost global status through its persistent claims
    that the ‘Net’ will create new markets and communities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Everyone will be able to buy and sell in cyberspace without
    restrictions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>States and
    governments will no longer be able to control electronic information or
    commerce, which can now freely cross national borders without the need of a
    passport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It seems to me that
    the Internet is America’s attempt to allow the world to cash in on the
    American dream of materialism and free speech.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>

padding:0cm;mso-padding-alt:0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The Internet is very much an American creation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>It evolved from a computer system built 25 years ago by the Military
    to enable academic and military researchers to continue to do government
    work even if part of the network were taken out in a nuclear attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Like many Cold War inventions, the Net could have remained an
    official secret.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
    according to Barbrook, when it was being developed within the universities,
    academics and students hijacked the new technology for their own purposes<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>

padding:0cm;mso-padding-alt:0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In terms of the Internet and its applications, from on-line
    discussion groups and electronic mail to the Web, it is certainly the case
    that many of its features were initially developed by amateur enthusiasts as
    shareware, with no real obligation to pay to use them. This non-commercial
    ethos attracted others who began to develop the Internet as a new form of
    community media.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was the
    growth in this initial ‘DIY culture’ that caused large software
    manufacturers to invest heavily in developing and marketing commercial
    browser software.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The legal war
    between Netware and Microsoft over control of the Internet that resulted in
    Microsoft facing a ‘$1m a day fine imposed by US federal government for
    abuse of monopoly power’ (<i>Source: </i><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">BBC
    Website</a> 14/11/97), clearly stressing the importance of the Internet in
    America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the so-called ‘browser
    war’, Microsoft has been accused of employing ‘unfair practices’ with
    the bundled distribution of its Internet Explorer with the Windows 95
    operating system, not allowing for users to purchase their Internet software
    from the range of companies who were previously offering web browsing
    facilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is alarming,
    especially as 85% of computers purchased for home nowadays are IBM
    compatible PC’s (‘<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Guardian Online’</i>,
    2/3/95, p.7).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interestingly,
    the company has avoided being accused of such tactics in the future by
    ensuring that Internet capabilities are embedded into Windows 98, rendering
    Web browsing an integral part of their future software releases.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, Microsoft has been accused of ‘trying to hijack the
    Internet to convert it from an open information highway to a private toll
    road’ (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ibid.</i> 18/11/97).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The reason that Microsoft and other corporations are now pouring
    billions of dollars into cyberspace is because they have to catch up with
    the widespread use of the Net by the state-funded institutions and the DIY
    culture.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="border:none;mso-border-bottom-alt:solid windowtext .75pt;
padding:0cm;mso-padding-alt:0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I do not believe that the Internet will offer the world an
    unregulated marketplace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its
    brief history already shows the convergence of state, commercial and
    community interests within the emerging digital structure.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Each sector will depend on the other, in order to exist and
    each will have a role to fulfil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Certainly
    in the UK, I find it unlikely that a ‘national data grid’ will be
    established, linking all households and businesses unless the public applies
    heavy pressure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If it is left
    to unregulated market forces to offer universal access to new information,
    it will take a long time, if it ever even happens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>However, the construction of the fibre-optic grid, covering most of
    the UK implies the definite commercial potential of the Internet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Unlike its predecessors, the BBC, British Telecom etc, which
    flourished under state ownership and control, the Internet is not, nor ever
    likely to become, even partially state controlled.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>

yes">&nbsp; </span>The problem at the moment is not the technology itself, but
    the distribution of new technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    Internet connects more than 100 countries, but there are around 90 more
    outside it. The have-nots all number among the world’s poorer countries (‘<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Guardian
    Online’</i>, 7/7/94, p.7).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite
    Clinton’s promise to ‘grant’ access of the Internet to the developing
    world, it is apparent that there is still a long way to go. Despite it’s
    claims to be the new global information highway, the Internet’s map of the
    world resembles a medieval mariners’ chart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Most of Africa is blank, the Far East has conspicuous holes, and
    Eastern Europe is scarcely chartered, while South America is just sketched
    in. (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ibid.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>However, where there is access it can be seen as being positive. For
    example, in Korea and Taiwan, more than 25% of PC sales are destined for
    home rather than commercial use. (‘<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

    the country is run, both on a local as well as a national level. Emailing
    will help in improving communication links between representative and the
    electorate, as already demonstrated by Cambridge’s Anne Campbell: ‘Direct
    Digital democracy has a role to play in the running of neighbourhoods. For
    example it could be used to ensure that tenants become involved in how their
    estate is managed and what new services they require. It would relocate
    intelligence on how the public service is run from producer to the consumer.
    This process of democratisation would be a massive cultural shift for
    deferential, hierarchical UK’ (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">‘Wired

    the part of citizens; it is now possible to put your views across directly
    to the source. This is a direct example of the nature of new technologies;

    which could ultimately serve as an arena where we will be able to recover
    the meaning and the experience of community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Rheingold believes that we have ‘access to a tool that could bring
    conviviality and understanding into our lives and might help revitalise the

    the small-town public sphere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
    a world in which every citizen is networked to every other citizen, we can
    expand this ideal to the scale of McLuhan’s ‘global village’; a vision

padding:0cm;mso-padding-alt:0cm 0cm 1.0pt 0cm"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>However, I believe that even when the whole population is
    eventually on-line, this ‘utopia’ of ‘direct’ democracy will still
    face the most important obstacle of all: the problem of how large numbers of
    people can communicate and collectively make decisions. I cannot believe
    that a new technology can solve fundamental social and political problems by
    itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if the Internet
    eliminates the physical limitations of space and time by gathering citizens
    together in one place by creating virtual spaces, it cannot remove the
    entirely social problem of how large groups of people can successfully
    interact with one another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>From
    my experience of using mIRC, an Internet ‘Relay Chat’ program, I often
    found it frustrating that I could not hold a meaningful conversation with
    anyone when everyone was fighting for ‘air-time’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Unless a virtual ‘room’ only consists of a small number of
    people, some form of representation will have to be used to mediate between
    the different social, cultural and geographical groups wishing to shape
    political decision-making, particularly on a large scale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Aside from this, wiring up the country will never eliminate the need
    for professional politicians, even if it does change the way in which we can
    interface with them.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>

    arise when we begin to consider its natural bias, or at least heavy
    dependence, on the English language.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although
    on some of the more global web pages it is possible to select your own
    language from a largely restricted list of alternatives, full access is
    granted to those who are largely based in a Western society and can
    understand the Internet’s ‘global’ language.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>People who are not native English speakers are forced to adapt to
    this American technology, and thus adopt the English language in order to be
    able to navigate freely through cyberspace.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>For a large demographic of the World, even the alphabet on a PC
    keyboard comprises of foreign symbols.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Therefore, even though such far-off locations, for example, remote
    parts of China will soon be connected, those who are not competent in
    English will, ultimately, remain excluded and in turn silenced within the
    global, even national vision of ‘community’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

    a windows based PC like any other browser. It will be distributed freely, in
    the spirit of free speech advocated by the Internet, as shareware, and holds

    most important factors influencing this view is the universality of
    agreement - the media agrees, the Developed World agrees, the Developing
    World agrees. The possibilities are endless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The Internet potentially offers hope to millions left behind by today’s
    society - the disabled, the unemployed, the elderly etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Access does not necessarily have to rely on knowledge or financial
    circumstances; more and more provisions are being made, such as the
    introduction of Internet terminals into public libraries and cyber-cafes, to
    cater for those who cannot afford to buy a PC outright.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>

    standards and increased poverty, the Net fills a gap. Communication between
    peers, which might be denied to those who are not in work for example, is
    possible via email, newsgroups etc. The Internet is also a useful tool to
    maintain contact with home, or family, in a time when there is increasing
    commuting within jobs, and long distance travel is a [sometimes a day to
    day] fact rather than a rarity.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>

yes">&nbsp; </span>The Internet permits the fragmentation of society in that
    common links can be made between any groups around any common factor, from
    sense of nationality, to liking a particular science fiction programme. It
    is much more difficult to define people according to set boundaries, as the
    parameters by which people identify themselves have shifted boundlessly. The
    fear that IT will bring about homogeneity and a global Americanisation does
    not necessarily have to hold true - although I think it is likely to happen
    - unless people decide freely to subscribe to that common identity.
    Hollywood may have dominated much of popular culture up to now, but with the
    increasing emphasis on personalised entertainment, this era might be over.
    Europe for example, has a rich cultural heritage, as does Asia, with
    increasing numbers of people trained and willing to distribute this
    information on the Internet, providing an alternative to a bland homogenised
    culture promoted by the Movies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    diversity is in-built in the experience of communicating and operating on
    the Internet: ‘the Internet mediates human interaction better than any
    other medium’, says futurist Paul Saffo: ‘Getting in touch with each
    other is more fun than the coolest computer game, or the hottest information’.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title><span style="mso-special-character:footnote" class="MsoFootnoteReference"><![if !supportFootnotes]>

    </span></a> Stephen Fry supports this view: ‘when you have a keyboard
    under your fingers, you can say things that are extraordinarily honest. This
    is one of the wonderful things about e-mail that is often overlooked’. (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">‘Evening Standard’</i>, 3/11/95). In what can be seen as a
    reinforcement of this phenomenon, Mark Poster argues that message services
    have proven themselves immensely popular in France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>The country’s 1980s on-line system, ‘Minitel’, which was
    similar in content and style to the British ‘Prestel’ system was
    believed to foster ‘not the autonomous, rational, stable individual but
    the playful, imaginative multiple self’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>(Poster, 1995).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
    argued that ‘people seem to enjoy a communication technology in which they
    invent themselves in the process of exchanging signs’. (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ibid.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Although honesty and the imagined self might seem to be conflicting,
    the connection between the two is the movement towards new modes of
    communication which do not play a part in normal face-to-face interaction.
    This can only be seen as a bonus in that reinvention of society necessitates
    new forms of communication, fostered by the Internet.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>

    be a positive life changing experience. They can choose whether or not to
    disclose their disability (if they have one) and they also have the
    advantage of anonymity in this unique social situation. For one who may have
    a low-self image due to physical appearance, or in cases of extreme shyness
    in social situations, this becomes almost a non-issue on-line. Other users
    cannot see what a person looks like, nor can they identify discomfort in
    posture or the hesitant speech of someone with extreme shyness. This is a
    unique new social situation and the lack of a synchronous Face To Face
    presence gives the actor far greater control over the developing definition
    of the situation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The user has
    an opportunity to present the ‘ideal self’ and sustain that presentation
    throughout the interaction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
    barriers in communication discussed above are not present when sitting
    behind a monitor and keyboard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
    such situations, people have the opportunity to practice communicating with
    others, portraying themselves with more confidence than they may actually
    have in reality. This can be a good thing, as this can be a system of
    positive re-enforcement of social behaviour, learned in an on-line
    environment, which they can then carry out into their real lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>However, this has disadvantages for somebody like myself, where I
    will often dismiss most of what I am told over the Internet, as I am aware

    17/2/96, p.11).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proficiency
    gained from continuous practice led to a reported feeling of belonging,
    playing a part in society: ‘It really did in some way allow them to
    transcend poverty and disability’ (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ibid.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>One woman, worried that her computer would be removed after the power
    cable had been chewed through by a rat, pleaded to be allowed to keep the
    computer, saying ‘I know that I’m in poverty. But when I get on the
    Internet, nobody else knows it’ (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ibid.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>In the same way that anonymity makes dating so much less fraught on
    the Net, so this same quality transcends traditional social boundaries.
    Where acquisition of technology used to be seen as a way of “keeping up
    with the Joneses”, now the increasing ease of access could potentially
    render social divides invisible, at least while the user is on-line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>Also, with the inclusion of Internet technology with the Digital
    Terrestrial TV network, due to come on-line later this year, it should
    become possible for anyone to experience a society without the traditional
    enforced hierarchical boundaries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Anonymity
    is the key to a more tolerant society; hierarchical bias and prejudice
    cannot play a part in communication when there is no knowledge of the

    more electrical devices with on-line capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>For example, the release of Digital Terrestrial Television in the UK
    later this year will ultimately fuse together the Internet with television.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

    </span>Jobs in the future are far more likely to be based on short-term
    contracts where, rather than stay working in one job until retirement,
    skills will be carried from one job to the next and people will carry with
    them ‘portfolios’ of their previous employment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>This seems to me to be more like a self-employed profession, such as
    that for an actor or freelance writer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
    </span>I can see a definite tendency towards self-employment where more
    people manage their own careers, working on short-term contracts.</p>
