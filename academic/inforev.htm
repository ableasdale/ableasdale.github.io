<p class=MsoBodyText>New technology is as much a social product as the shape of 
  society is a technological product.  There is a constant interplay between ‘technology’ 
  and ‘society’ (Lyon, 1988:viii).</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText>Of course technology does not determine society … technology 
  <i>is</i> society, and society cannot be understood or represented without its 
  technological tools (Castells, 1996:5).  </p>
<p>  As Kochen (1987:142) explains, the term ‘information society’ is a ‘much 
  overworked expression, used to denote many different concepts’<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a>.  Cairncross (1997:2) cites AT&amp;T’s chairman Robert Allen’s 
  (1995) claims that he was absolutely unable to predict the ways in which technology 
  would affect [transform] <i>his</i> business within the next decade.  At this 
  time Allen had little more insight to share other than his comment that ‘something 
  startling, intriguing and profound’ was afoot.  Castells (1996:5) talks about 
  the ‘information technology revolution’ in relation to its pervasiveness throughout 
  the whole realm of human activity.  At outset, Castells is wary of aligning 
  his arguments with models of technological determinism; technology does not 
  determine society: it embodies it.  Likewise, society does not determine technological 
  innovation: it uses it.  At its fundamental level, then, it seems clear that 
  any discussion of an ‘information revolution’ will need to take into account 
  the ‘dialectical interaction’, or ‘constant interplay’ between the technology 
  on the one hand and the society on the other.  One, of course, cannot be understood 
  without the other and this was perhaps the key issue that Raymond Williams (1974) 
  isolated; the imposition of a statement that the ‘information revolution’ is 
  taking place undercuts, or masks many important historical and philosophical 
  questions<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a>.  
  To follow Williams arguments further, if we are to adopt the notion of the ‘information 
  revolution’ and apply it to our current condition, then are we pursuing a causal 
  or an effectual model of this, or will we find that neither can be separated? 
  Any study of ‘effects’ will remain superficial if we have not looked into the 
  notions of cause and effect between a technology and a society, a culture or 
  a psychology (1974:43).  This approach invites heavy interrogation and perhaps 
  explains why Allen could do little more than imply that some intangible change 
  seems imminent.</p>
<p>  My approach will be an attempt to isolate some of the factors surrounding 
  these ‘curiously startling changes’, firstly, to beg for an interrogation of 
  the term ‘revolution’ (surely if it <i>is</i> to be used, then it must be carefully 
  qualified and defined).  I find the word misleading; it has a certain historical 
  resonance that is inescapable.  The word, most likely, will always be considered 
  in relation to the periods of history that it became adopted for and deployed 
  with, instantly making me wary of talking about something that still exists 
  as ‘unwritten history’.  If these ‘big changes’ are to be ‘revolutionary’, then 
  how can we measure our ‘revolutionary’ state at present?  Is the revolution 
  just beginning (if so, when did it begin), and at what point does it finish 
  (indeed, has it almost finished?).  I have isolated several key areas I would 
  like to discuss to express a belief I have that what we are experiencing may 
  be more accurately expressed in terms of an ongoing technological ‘evolution’: 
  a process which encourages change, but in terms of technological advancement 
  remains surprisingly predictable.  What begins to create the ‘illusion’ of revolution, 
  then, is the <i>incorporation</i> of these technologies into the patterns and 
  routines of our daily lives, and the ways in which they can be said to shape 
  and configure <i>us</i>.  I will open the discussion with an examination of 
  Frank Webster’s (1999) questions concerning <i>what</i> the information society 
  <i>is</i>, using his terms to investigate the claims surrounding the ‘information 
  revolution’.  Secondly, I will examine some of the technologies that are partially 
  ‘implicated’ in this revolution and test them to see if they are ready to meet 
  up with their intended purposes or whether, perhaps unrealistic expectations 
  have been placed onto them.</p>
<h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>Webster’s Information Society</h2>
<p>  What is an information society?<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> 
  [3] </span></a> Webster (1999:139-40) accuses many writers on the subject of 
  being too eager to talk about the rate of change in the light of different forms 
  of economic production, social interaction or innovation in production, and 
  claims that by doing so, they often neglect to take into consideration the centrality 
  of the information itself and <i>its</i> contributions and implications.  He 
  offers five definitions for the ‘information society’, each offering criteria 
  for identifying ‘the new’: <i>technological</i>, <i>economic</i>, <i>occupational</i>, 
  <i>spatial</i> and <i>cultural</i>.  The <i>technological</i> ‘new’ refers to 
  Moores (1965) Law<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
title=""><span> [4] </span></a> and the notion that every eighteen months, computer 
  processing ability doubles: a statistic that has held true for three decades 
  and still holds true now (<i>see </i>Cairncross 1997:10).  That such a model 
  (in terms of technological development) can become subject to such a rule, suggests 
  that if a ‘revolution’ were to occur, then it would not be with computer processing 
  power; that the technology doubles every eighteen months implies a model of 
  technological <i>evolution</i>, as the same quota of output has been met steadily 
  for three decades.  In addition, increase in processing speed has met with continual 
  downsizing - perhaps the more revolutionary of the two – although such a process 
  has occurred steadily (although it is doubtful whether every piece of technology 
  halves exactly in size every eighteen months).  </p>
<p>  In terms of Webster’s <i>economic</i> model, a change is occurring, seemingly 
  in tandem with technological development and incorporation, which redefines 
  the role of ‘information’ (processed data) as a key commodity.  In this sense, 
  as Peter Drucker (1969) argued, a shift began to occur ‘from an economy of goods 
  [to] … a knowledge economy’ (<i>cit.</i> Webster 1999:144).  Following this 
  line of argument, then, knowledge and organisation have become the prime creators 
  of wealth<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span> [5] </span></a>; the 
  shift, it seems is towards knowledge production and information processing, 
  rather than physical production (manufacture).  This argument is convincingly 
  reinforced by Thurow (1992:2): ‘look at who the banks have been hiring recently.  
  Salomon Brothers last year hired as many computer programmers and telecommunications 
  experts as they did financial experts’.  Here Thurow is, I think, working on 
  the assumption that computer programmers will produce commodities that will 
  store and process <i>more efficiently</i> information to enable banks to optimise 
  their own internal functioning and increase profit.  This is an undeniable shift; 
  empirical evidence proves this.  However: more questions urgently need to be 
  addressed: why are banks adapting their strategies in such ways?  Is the banking 
  sector undergoing a ‘revolution’?  In a way, it could be argued that this is 
  so; Thurow explains that he can buy currency from London without visiting it, 
  he can sell his house in Boston using German Marks and then undertake a deal 
  in the Bahamas, theoretically from any point in the world at any time (<i>Ibid.</i>), 
  which justifies the banks’ dependence on and investment in computer programmers.  
  Is this revolutionary?  In terms of the ways in which banking takes place, we 
  could be convinced by his arguments, however, for Thurow’s transactions a telephone 
  network <i>would</i> suffice, even if the process may take slightly longer.  
  In terms of the drive towards the obsolescence of national central banks (now 
  thanks to ICTs, no longer important in ‘wired’ areas), a revolution could also 
  be occurring.  However, this could be seen as a symptom (by-product?) of capitalist 
  evolution.  Simply that Japanese banks would ‘drive every other bank out of 
  the world of business because they were willing to put up satellites and build 
  better telecommunications networks than the banks in Europe and the United States’ 
  (<i>Ibid.</i>), epitomises the essence of capitalist competition in the marketplace.  
  In other words: the link is between the bank and the technology; as the speed 
  of the technology <i>increases, </i>so does the speed a transaction can occur.  
  By virtue of their emphasis upon efficient communication and transmission, the 
  Japanese banks are, quite simply, the first to make the transaction and therefore 
  begin to seize the most control.  This, I believe, begins to look more like 
  evolution in action: Darwinism within a capitalist framework, survival of the 
  fittest.</p>
<p>  The <i>occupational</i> model explains the redefinition of occupational distribution: 
  simply that an information society can be said to exist when the ‘white collar 
  society’ (the informational work force) begins to visibly outstrip labour-based 
  workers (the parallels Webster draws here are between clerks, teachers, lawyers 
  and entertainers on the one hand and coal miners, steelworkers, dockers and 
  builders on the other) <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""> [6] </a>.  
  As soon as Webster has constructed this distinction, he warily criticises the 
  measure, explaining that labour-intensive work ‘declines to be replaced by more 
  and more manipulation of figures … so we are entering a new type of society’ 
  (1999:147).  The ‘new society’ certainly <i>creates</i> new job descriptions, 
  and makes many others redundant, so is this where the revolution is taking place?  
  Thurow (1992:1) suggests that to his mind, only two inventions have revolutionised 
  the industrial world: the train and electricity; both caused changes significant 
  enough to be considered ‘revolutionary’ processes.  He argues that in comparison, 
  the automobile - whilst undoubtedly changing the landscape - was not significant 
  enough to warrant a ‘revolutionary’ tag; without its invention there would be 
  more trains<a
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span> [7] </span></a>.  However, the automobile 
  created new jobs (as did trains) in addition to making others redundant, and 
  here, albeit with sceptical caution, a parallel can be drawn with the ‘rise’ 
  of the ‘information society’ in terms of the significant re-structuring that 
  is taking place at home and in the office<a href="#_ftn8"
name="_ftnref8" title=""><span> [8] </span></a>.  If the automobile <i>is only</i> 
  to be seen as ‘evolutionary’ after the ‘revolutionary’ steam train, then we 
  could likewise argue that the ‘information revolution’ <i>only </i>really evolved 
  from what came before.  So the unanswered question remains: if a revolution 
  <i>is </i>taking place, then to point can its origins be traced?  Was it the 
  discovery of electricity, the telephone, the calculator, the home computer or 
  the computer network (the Internet)?  Or a combination of technological development 
  (<i>cf</i> Moores Law) and the point at which it was met by technological convergence?</p>
<p>  The <i>spatial</i> model, then, adopts the premise that ‘information is coming 
  to occupy centre stage as the key strategic resource on which the organisation 
  of the world economy is dependent’ (Webster 1999:151) and that ICTs provide 
  the infrastructure for processing and distribution of information (<i>Ibid.</i>).  
  That ICTs are (and can be) networked calls into question older conceptions of 
  space and power, which in turn has, to some extent, overshadowed the nineteenth 
  century’s physical infrastructure of railways, canals and roads (Webster 1999:153 
  <i>cit.</i> Mulgan, 1991:3), although it has by no means made them obsolete.  
  So the <i>spatial</i> model is drawing upon Giddens’ (1990) notion of ‘time/space 
  compression’ (<i>cit. Ibid.</i>).  On a global level this <i>compression</i> 
  can be <i>seen to</i> exist; Cairncross (1997:28) demonstrates the steep descent 
  in the price of a three-minute call from New York to London and talks enthusiastically 
  about the ‘disappearing distance premium’ (<i>Ibid.</i>:30): the increase in 
  capacity and the falling cost of provision.  New cables have wider bandwidths 
  than before and satellites can move information more efficiently than before.  
  Yet networks are as old as life itself, indeed they are the basis for all carbon-based 
  (and robotic) life.  More realistically, Webster (1999:153) offers examples 
  such as the postal service and the telegram as two examples of early ‘information 
  networks’ to be depended upon, so when is a network a network? Was a connection 
  between two telephones the first sign of revolution? Webster, perhaps wisely 
  (or realistically), does not answer such questions although he does state that 
  the ‘information revolution’ is perhaps signified by ‘instantaneous’ global 
  satellite communication (although I am sceptical about the use of such a word); 
  that because a database can be accessed simultaneously from Oxford to Los Angeles, 
  Tokyo and Paris, is significant enough to earn its revolutionary status.  However, 
  perhaps the main question still remains: when does a network become a network?  
  PC World now offer for home (or small business) buyers ‘network solutions’ consisting 
  of five PCs, cables and a hub for £2000, although a LAN, whilst fine for file 
  sharing between machines, networked gaming and ‘distributed processing’ for 
  demanding tasks such as 3D rendering, is only going to be able to communicate 
  with anything outside the terminals on the hub when connected to analogue (modem) 
  or digital (ISDN, ADSL etc.) lines.  Much is still left unanswered with Webster’s 
  analysis, and this is duly my concern with my analysis of this model.</p>
<p>  Finally Webster (1999:154-6) arrives at the <i>cultural </i>paradigm; where 
  the ‘information society’ becomes defined as a result of increasing incorporation 
  of <i>information</i> into every available space; in both the public and the 
  private sphere.  As Webster suggests, we inhabit a media-laden society: one 
  so heavily coded that clothing becomes ‘informational content’ for the body, 
  the person and the surrounding culture (154).  The home is also richly laden 
  in precisely this way (155).  Webster concludes by arguing that a society encoded 
  in this way has lead to an explosion of <i>signification</i>: that existence 
  becomes a continual process of exchange and reception of messages concerning 
  ‘ourselves and others’ (<i>Ibid.</i>).  Such saturation must, surely raise questions 
  of the <i>value</i> of information.  If society becomes surrounded by, and subject 
  to, a constant ‘abundance of media provisions, by choice or by force’ (<i>See 
  </i>Ang and Hermes, 1991:322), to the extent that informational ‘texts’ constantly 
  re-configure and overlap each other (by virtue of there being so many), then 
  can signs carry the same meaning as before?  What constituted <i>meaning</i> 
  taken from signs before this time?  How can this meaning be measured, quantified 
  and understood both historically and in the present?  What does become clear 
  is that a perpetual bombardment of signs will lead to some collapse in meaning 
  for <i>individual </i>signs, which, perhaps like the ensemble of overlapping 
  texts Ang and Hermes discussed, will become impossible to separate from each 
  another (<i>see</i> Baudrillard 1970:33; 1983:95); increasing information leads 
  to a ‘bewildering web of [contradictory] signs that … lose their salience’ (Webster 
  1999:155).  Signs therefore become self-referential; <i>simulations</i> which, 
  in their millions, define our grip of the condition of ‘hyper reality’ (156).  
  Such a category, in relation to our definition of the ‘information revolution’, 
  becomes confusing: while we can perhaps describe the postmodern ‘condition’ 
  in which we live, it seems that difficulty lies in extracting specific information 
  from the sign/meaning, sign/sign, technology/society dyads.  To talk of a ‘revolution’ 
  is all very well but if it exists, then it is a ‘revolution’ concerning precisely 
  our condition of understanding our own sense of self in relation to a backdrop 
  (cacophony) of conflicting signs that perpetually blur our focus; we need to 
  be <i>selective</i> (if we can still do so) in where we start looking for clues 
  as to the existence of the ‘information revolution’.  The word ‘revolution’ 
  is historically coded and, as with any sign, offers several overlapping layers 
  of meaning.  Our terms of revolution must be clearly signposted and a ‘quantity’ 
  of informational ‘bits’ must be isolated from the mass, measured and grouped 
  to enable the grasp of a <i>thread</i> of the ‘condition’.  A ‘revolution’ could 
  easily be construed, bound up in the wide-eyed notion that <i>something</i> 
  startling, intriguing and profound is afoot: meaning something in its widest, 
  most distorted, abstract and vague form.  Taken as a whole, the term can quickly 
  consume those who examine it, if not treated with caution.</p>
<h2>&nbsp; </h2>
<h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>The Information Revolution: Technological 
  Considerations</h2>
<h2>&nbsp; </h2>
<h2>The Principle of Computer Networking</h2>
<p>  At the core of any <i>technological</i> argument concerning the ‘information 
  revolution’ lies the emergence of networking and Castells’ notion of the rise 
  of the ‘network society’.  Networks themselves are not a new phenomenon; the 
  industrial revolution was only able to take place by virtue of both electrical 
  networks, and networks of roads linking one area to another to enable, in its 
  broadest context, ‘communication’ between areas.  All organic matter utilise 
  internal networks for passage of substance (and information) from one point 
  to another.  In this light it becomes easy to understand the benefit of adopting 
  such structures.  While it is true that computer devices continue to grow in 
  power and shrink in size<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span> [9] 
  </span></a>, their exponential growth stems from their interconnectivity.  If 
  we are to subscribe to the view that we are approaching the ‘year of the network’, 
  then <i>perhaps</i> this is its year; now even the most basic computing device 
  now seems to have facilities for networking built-in and for those that don’t, 
  devices such as bluetooth<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span> 
  [10] </span></a> are being developed in an attempt to allow one device to communicate 
  with any other.  While it is <i>no</i> surprise that networks allow one PC to 
  talk to other PCs (even on a global scale), what was perhaps less predictable 
  was that PCs would talk to devices of <i>all</i> varieties on a global scale, 
  using the same network.  Perhaps this is one such argument, albeit somewhat 
  <i>technologically deterministic</i>, to support the premise that an information 
  revolution is occurring; if it is, then I believe the ‘life’ of its own TCP/IP 
  has acquired, rather than the power of the network devices themselves, that 
  serve this premise most effectively.  Much <i>could</i> be said on the ‘revolutionary’ 
  aspect of TCP/IP and it is around this protocol that so many envisage the <i>Matrix</i>-like 
  scenario where we’re all connected all the time to ‘the network’ becomes an 
  everyday reality.  Although TCP/IP - whose own ubiquity constitutes a self-made 
  ‘global standard’ - provides us with a neat argument for Webster’s early question 
  of when a network <i>becomes </i>a network, the argument of evolution rears 
  into the argument.  It could be argued that TCP/IP evolved <i>naturally</i> 
  from military research and development in the face of a sinister conflict.  
  That it <i>happened</i> to provide hopes (and TCP/IP <i>is </i>restricted, not 
  in terms of speed or bandwidth, but in terms of the <i>limit</i> of available 
  addresses and their subsequent organisation and configuration) for something 
  that suddenly began to appear ‘revolutionary’ is symptomatic of the technology/society 
  dyad; that the new technology is as much a <i>social</i> product as the shape 
  of society is a <i>technological</i> product in this instance appears justifiable: 
  the ‘revolutionary’ meaning then stems from the ways we <i>may</i> be able to 
  use TCP/IP to enrich our everyday lives, and to re-configure our own lives (using 
  potentially ‘global’ parameters).</p>
<h2>New technologies and ‘new’ forms of communication: Satellites and Cables</h2>
<p>  Having considered the ‘evolutionary’ principles of convergence and notions 
  of integration and downsizing, I would like to turn to another technological 
  ‘revolution’.  It could perhaps be argued that the appearance of McLuhan’s prophecy 
  of the global village/global marketplace was made possible, in part, through 
  mediation of orbital satellites<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span> 
  [11] </span></a>.  Satellites are perhaps most commonly used for streaming information 
  down to earth, but widespread usage quickly exposes their weaknesses for consistent 
  real-time two-way communication because of delays in relay; the signal has to 
  travel to and from the satellite from source to destination.  Satellites are 
  primarily concerned with voice and business communication, and still offer too 
  minimal bandwidth and unacceptable delays before any visions of an ‘Internet 
  in the sky’ to occur.  GEO satellites can only be used for streaming information 
  down to earth, as their orbital distance from earth makes two-way communication 
  undesirable.  LEOs are more ideally suited for seemingly ‘full-duplex’ communication, 
  although the closer the satellite is to earth, the bigger the ‘constellation’ 
  of satellites are needed to provide fluid transmission, instantly providing 
  two problems: firstly, if more satellites are required, launch and maintenance 
  costs will increase right down the chain (and surely <i>cost</i> is a pre-requisite 
  for any consideration of a ‘revolution’ for <i>all</i>), more satellites mean 
  increased risk of faults occurring within the service (more areas to monitor 
  and increased problems to troubleshoot) and a greater number of LEO satellites 
  means an increased risk of damage from fast moving space debris.</p>
<p>  So if we are to look at the constraints of the carriers, we see the emergence 
  of a number of issues: firstly, there exists a question of whether the technology 
  is able to deliver what its society demands; whether the expectations demanded 
  by the ‘information revolution’ can currently be met, and are available at an 
  affordable price, and secondly, whether all of this counts towards ‘revolutionary’ 
  change.  The second point is, as I have already discussed, very much relative 
  on our own perceptions of technology, society and notions of what constitutes 
  ‘revolutionary’ change, whereas the first invites a whole host of questions 
  surrounding location, regulation, ‘state’ of development and so on.  Certainly, 
  the carrier technology is improving at the digital end; The next generation 
  of GSM mobile phone will see an increase in data transfer rate (currently at 
  9,600bits/sec) and many new ‘small devices’ (many of which are phones) now support 
  familiar standards such as <i>Windows CE</i> and <i>java</i> meaning subsequent 
  generations are going to behave more like personal computers than before, facilitating 
  email, browsing, video conferencing (business communications) etc.  At present, 
  in the UK if we want fast access we have to pay for it.  ISDN-based access for 
  networks and businesses is still an overpriced luxury, largely to discourage 
  too many people from adding strain to the networks.  ADSL and NTL’s cable modems 
  will eventually offer cheaper alternatives, although these are yet to materialise.  
  Oftel, it seems, is still reviewing much of the information and has not reached 
  any final conclusions as yet, causing all service providers to delay launching 
  their products.  When such technologies <i>do</i> begin to materialise, charge 
  for access will move from the cost of a local call (a subject under examination 
  at present), to a weekly/monthly rate, no doubt mediated by the major ISPs on 
  behalf of the communications companies…  </p>
<h2>…Towards a Conclusion</h2>
<p><b>   </b>It seems all too easy to lose sight of the important questions: what 
  <i>are</i> the social implications of such changes?   In recent decades there 
  has been a significant trend towards more people living on their own; fears 
  concerning safety result in children being kept indoors, to be ‘minded’ by an 
  array of ICTs assembled in the home for this reason.  Working patterns are becoming 
  less predictable, perhaps challenging pre-existing notions of ‘family’.   Anthropologists 
  at San José State University in California were examining the evolving nature 
  of middle-class homes in Silicon Valley.  One of their findings was the extent 
  to which the families treated both work and family life as tasks to be managed 
  and scheduled<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"
title=""><span> [12] </span></a>.  In such a ‘culture’, then, parental communication 
  with their children by email or pager is seen as evidence of caring and family 
  gatherings become known as ‘team meetings’.  A group of mothers construct a 
  database of childcare information to help them manage childcare more efficiently 
  and effectively.  It is, of course, impossible to say whether this culture is 
  better or worse than any of the others, but what is noteworthy is that a change 
  is taking place, which signals a move from interaction to transaction in daily 
  relationships, and greater self-preoccupation.</p>
<p class=MsoFooter>  With every new change, for everything old and familiar that 
  is lost or erodes partially, something new is introduced to redress the balance, 
  soon to become familiar.  If the ‘revolution’ that is taking place will challenge 
  our concepts of identity and privacy and may erode many of the social bonds 
  we now depend upon, but it will surely create new ones in the same way.  After 
  all: humans evolve and perhaps some old and familiar aspects are still too deeply 
  rooted for upheaval.  Finally, the information poverty debate still exists.  
  Despite large-scale technological development, downsizing, convergence, increased 
  demand for the technology and the luxury of greater supply and cheaper products, 
  there are still large areas of the world that still function without a reliable 
  supply of electricity<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span> [13] 
  </span></a>.</p>
<p class=MsoFooter>  If we are to turn again to the ‘information revolution’, 
  it is clear that the questions are not clearly posed by such a statement and 
  are in effect, conveniently masked by them.  Both words need to be approached 
  with caution; together they can seem ambiguous unless considered alongside an 
  ongoing interplay between technology and society.  Our notions of what our society 
  <i>means</i> to us at any time will be focused, configured, through the tools 
  it creates - or uses - to construct, reconstruct and then measure itself as 
  a society.  We must consider the historical and philosophical questions that 
  surround this technology/society interplay; what does such a bind mean to the 
  <i>political </i>structuring of the ways we will conduct our lives?  How and 
  in what ways are we going to live together in the future?  What new aspects 
  will be introduced to challenge old assumptions and what will stay firmly rooted?</p>

    definition of this change [later critiqued heavily by Robins and Webster (1987)]; 
    he concludes that out of the ‘new’ society emerges a new professional class, 
    based on <i>knowledge</i> rather than property, and that issues over the ‘control 
    system’ of society shifts from ‘successor-occupational classes’ to ‘political 
    order’.  He is however clear that the question of management of the political 
    order becomes increasingly open; he is also using the U.S. as the <i>only</i> 
    model of post-industrialised society (63), and therefore working in a U.S. 
    exclusive framework which is 27 years old and, it must be observed, some structural 
    changes will have occurred within this space.</p>

    at three orbit levels: LEO, MEO and GEO (Low, Medium and Geostationary Earth 
    Orbit).  GEOs fly at 36,000km and appear stationary above us.  As a result, 
    eight carefully placed GEOs can cover the entire earth.  LEOs orbit between 
    500 and 2,000km and MEOs can orbit anywhere between LEOs and GEOs (<i>Figures

    on the ‘revolution’ of electricity.  Electricity, he argued, was revolutionary 
    because it made night usable.  That ‘to live in a world with absolutely no 
    electricity … is a very different experience from the life that most of us 
    are used to’.  Similarly, Grant Kester (1994) cites James W. Carey’s examination 
    of the importance of electricity, which he hailed as a revolution purporting 
    to bring an ‘end to drudgery, congestion, noise, smoke, and filth … [it promised] 
    the same freedom, decentralization, ecological harmony, and democratic community 
    that had hitherto been guaranteed but left undelivered by mechanization’.</p>
